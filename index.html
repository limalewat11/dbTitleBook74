They spill into the street and down to the corners and Lillian Leyb, who has spent her first thirty-five days in this country ripping stitches out of navy silk flowers until her hands were dyed blue, thinks that it is like an all-girl Ellis Island: American-looking girls chewing gum, kicking their high heels against the broken pavement, and girls so green they&#x2019;re still wearing fringed brown shawls over their braided hair. The street is like her village on market day, times a million. A boy playing a harp; a man with an accordion and a terrible, patchy little animal; a woman selling straw brooms from a basket strapped to her back, making a giant fan behind her head; a colored man singing in a pink suit and black shoes with pink spats; and tired women who look like women Lillian would have known at home in Turov, smiling at the song, or the singer. Some of the girls hold red sparklers in their hands and swing one another around the waist. A big girl with black braids plays the tambourine. A few American-looking girls make a bonfire on the corner, poking potatoes in and out of it. Two older women, pale and dark-eyed, are pulling along their pale, dark-eyed children. That&#x2019;s a mistake, Lillian thinks. They should ask a neighbor to watch the children. Or just leave the children in Gallagher&#x2019;s Bar and Grille at this point and hope for the best, but that&#x2019;s the kind of thing you say when you have no child. Lillian makes herself smile at the children as she walks past the women; they reek of bad luck.<br><br>Lillian is lucky. Her father had told her so; he told everyone after she fell in the Pripiat twice and didn&#x2019;t drown and didn&#x2019;t die of pneumonia. He said that smart was good (and Lillian was smart, he said) and pretty was useful (and Lillian was pretty enough) but lucky was better than both of them put together. He had hoped she&#x2019;d be lucky her whole life, he said, and she had been, at the time.<br><br>He also said, You make your own luck, and Lillian takes Judith, the only girl she knows, by the hand and they push their way through the middle of the crowd and then to the front. They are pushed themselves, then, into the place they want to be, the sewing room of the Goldfadn Theatre. They find themselves inches away from a dark, angry woman with a tight black bun (&#x201c;Litvak,&#x201d; Judith says immediately; her mother was a Litvak).<br><br>Suddenly, there are two men right in front of them, who, even the greenest girls can see, are stars in the firmament of life, visitors from a brighter, more beautiful planet. Mr. Reuben Burstein, owner of the Goldfadn and the Bartelstone theaters, the Impresario of Second Avenue, with his barrel chest and black silk vest and gray hair brushed back like Beethoven&#x2019;s. And his son, Mr. Meyer Burstein, the Matinee Idol, the man whose Yankl in The Child of Nature was so tragically handsome, so forceful a dancer, so sweet a tenor, that when he romanced the gentile Russian girl Natasha, women in the audience wept as if their husbands had abandoned them, and when Yankl killed himself, unwilling to marry poor pregnant Natasha and live as a Christian, everyone wept, not unhappily, at his beautiful, tortured death. Meyer Burstein is taller than his father, with a smart black fedora, a cigarette, and no vest over his silk shirt.<br><br>The two men move through the crowd like gardeners inspecting the flower beds of English estates, like plantation owners on market day. Whatever it is like, Lillian doesn&#x2019;t care. She will be the flower, the slave, the pretty thing or the despised and necessary thing, as long as she is the thing chosen from among the other things.<br><br>Mr. Burstein the elder stands close to Lillian and makes an announcement. His voice is such a pleasure to listen to that the girls stand there like fools, some of them with tears in their eyes at its gathering, thunderous quality, even as he is merely telling them that Miss Morris (the Litvak) will pass around a clipboard and they are to write down their names and their skills, or have someone write this down for them, and then Miss Morris will interview them all and indicate who should return tomorrow evening for more interviewing. There is a murmur at this; it was not so easy to get away for even one night, and Lillian thinks that the bad-luck mothers and the women who look as if they&#x2019;ve walked from Brooklyn will not be back.<br><br>Miss Morris approaches Lillian. Judith and Lillian have rehearsed for this moment. &#x201c;Very well, thank you,&#x201d; if the question seems to be about her health; &#x201c;I am a seamstress&#x2014;my father was a tailor,&#x201d; if the question contains the words &#x201c;sew,&#x201d; &#x201c;costume,&#x201d; or &#x201c;work&#x201d;; &#x201c;I attend night classes,&#x201d; said with a dazzling smile in response to any question she doesn&#x2019;t understand. Judith will get the job. Things being what they are, Lillian knows that a girl who can sew and speak English is a better choice than a girl who just got here and can barely do either.<br><br>Lillian studies the profile of Reuben Burstein; the impresario looks like a man from home. She heard his big, burnished voice, and like a small mark on a cheek, like a tilt in the little finger of a hand injured a long time ago, the tilt and the injury both forgotten, underneath she heard Yiddish.<br><br>Lillian moves. She presses close to Reuben Burstein and says, &#x201c;My name is Lillian Leyb. I speak Yiddish very well, as you can hear, and I also speak Russian very well.&#x201d; She digs her nails into her palms and switches into Russian. &#x201c;If you prefer it. My English is coming along.&#x201d; She adds in Yiddish, &#x201c;Az me muz, ken men,&#x201d; which is &#x201c;When one must, one can.&#x201d; When Reuben Burstein smiles, she adds, &#x201c;And I am fluent in sewing of every kind.&#x201d;<br><br>The Bursteins look at her. Miss Morris, who did have a Lithuanian mother but was born right here on the Lower East Side and graduated from the eighth grade and speaks standard Brooklyn English, also looks at Lillian, without enthusiasm. The crowd of women look at her as if she has just hoisted up her skirt to her waist and shown her bare bottom to the world; it is just that vulgar, that embarrassing, that effective.<br><br>The elder Mr. Burstein moves closer to Lillian. &#x201c;Bold,&#x201d; he says and he holds her chin in his hand like he will kiss her on the mouth. &#x201c;Bold. Bold is good.&#x201d; He waves his other hand toward Miss Morris, who tells all the women to form groups of four, to make it easier for her to speak to them. There are immediately fifteen groups of four. Lillian loses sight of Judith. She feels like a dog leaping over the garden wall. She smiles up at Reuben Burstein; she smiles at Meyer Burstein; she smiles, for good measure, at Miss Morris. Lillian has endured the murder of her family, the loss of her daughter, Sophie, an ocean crossing like a death march, intimate life with strangers in her cousin Frieda&#x2019;s two rooms, smelling of men and urine and fried food and uncertainty and need. Just so, she thinks, and she smiles at these three people, the new king and queen and prince of her life, as if she has just risen from a soft, high feather bed to enjoy an especially pretty morning.<br><br>Reuben Burstein says in Yiddish, &#x201c;Come back tomorrow morning, clever pussycat.&#x201d; Meyer Burstein says, &#x201c;Really, miss, how is your English?&#x201d; And Lillian says, very carefully, &#x201c;I attend night classes.&#x201d; She pauses and adds, &#x201c;And they go very well, thank you.&#x201d;<br><br>It had taken eight hours for Lillian to get from Ellis Island to the Battery Park of Manhattan and another four to find Cousin Frieda&#x2019;s apartment building. She had read Cousin Frieda&#x2019;s letter and the directions to Great Jones Street while she stood on three different lines in the Registry Room, while the doctor watched them all climb the stairs, looking for signs of lameness or bad hearts or feeblemindedness. (&#x201c;You step lively,&#x201d; a man had said to her on the crossing. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t want no idiots in America. Also,&#x201d; and he showed Lillian a card with writing on it, &#x201c;if you see something that looks like this, scratch your right ear.&#x201d; Lillian tried to memorize the shape of the letters. &#x201c;What does it say?&#x201d; &#x201c;What do you think? It says, &#x2018;Scratch your right ear.&#x2019; You do that, they think you can read English. My brother sent me this,&#x201d; the man said and he put the card back in his pocket, like a man with money.)<br><br>They had room, Cousin Frieda&#x2019;s letter had said, for family or dear friends. They had a little sewing business and could provide employment while people got on their feet. It was a great country, she wrote. Anyone could buy anything&#x2014;you didn&#x2019;t have to be gentry. There was a list of things Frieda had bought recently: a sewing machine (on installment but she had it already), white flour in paper sacks, condensed milk, sweet as cream and didn&#x2019;t go bad, Nestl�&#x2019;s powdered cocoa for a treat in the evening, hairpins that matched her hair color exactly, very good stockings, only ten cents. They had things here that people in Turov couldn&#x2019;t even imagine.<br><br>Lillian had walked through the last door, marked push to new york, and showed her letter to a man moving luggage onto the ferry. He smiled and shrugged. She held up the letter and the block-printed address a dozen times to faces that were blank, or worse than blank, knowing and dubious; she held it up, without much hope, to people who could not themselves read and pushed her aside as if she&#x2019;d insulted them. She hadn&#x2019;t imagined that in front of her new home, in her new country&#x2014;after the trolley cars and the men with signs on their fronts and their backs, the women in short skirts, the colored b...</p><h2>Word Biblical Commentary Vol. 11, 2 Samuel (anderson), 342pp</h2><p><p>The Word Biblical Commentary delivers the best in biblical scholarship, from the leading scholars of our day who share a commitment to Scripture as divine revelation.

While investigating murders has always meant discovering unpleasant facts and disquieting truths, the experienced Joanna isn't prepared for the knowledge she's about to uncover. Though she's tried to protect her children from the dangers of the grown-up world, the search for justice leads straight to her own door and forces her to face the possibility that her beloveddaughter may be less perfect than she seems&#x2014;especially when a photo from the crime scene ends up on Facebook.

Rendered in full color on every page are extravagantly colorful scenes and images, from the psychedelic visions evoked by &#x201c;Strawberry Fields&#x201d; to the youthful innocence that springs from &#x201c;She Loves You.&#x201d; Witty commentary and candid insights from John, Paul, George and Ringo make this a very special and personal tribute.</p><p>First published in 1969, this reissued collection of illustrated lyrics for 200 Beatles songs will be a treasure for any fan of the Fab Four. Editor and Beatle-buddy Alan Aldridge states in his introduction to the original edition: "What I have tried to do is present a book [that] is as entertaining to the eye and the imagination as a Beatles album is to the ear." Indeed, he more than succeeds, creating a lavish pageant of art and music that embraces not only the Beatles but also the psychedelic spirit of the entire era.<p> In 320 photos and illustrations, renowned artists offer their interpretations of various songs. "Help" is visualized by Ronald Searle; "Fixing a Hole," by Tomi Ungerer; "Glass Onion," by Peter Max; "I'm So Tired," by David Hockney; and "Oh, Darling," by Ralph Steadman. Aldridge also contributes his own trippy illustrations, which reflect the bold, bulbous, cartoons-on-acid style of 1960s poster art. This rich compilation also has brief quotes from the Beatles explaining the origins of the themes and lyrics of certain songs. For example, despite the buzz that "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" is about LSD, according to Paul, "What happened was that John's son Julian did a drawing at school and brought it home, and he has a schoolmate named Lucy, and John said, 'What's that?' and he said 'Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'" Band members also share their thoughts on superstardom, including this now weighty comment from John: "I don't intend to be a performing flea anymore. I was the dreamweaver, but although I'll be around I don't intend to be running at 20,000 miles an hour trying to prove myself. I don't want to die at 40." It can't bring them back, but <i>The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics</i> can take you on a long and winding road of nostalgia. <i>--Brangien Davis</i></p>Alan Aldridge is an award-winning graphic designer and artist based in London.

Isaac&#39;s life (c. 2066--1886 B.C.) Jacob&#39;s life (c. 2006--1859 B.C.) Joseph&#39;s life (c. 1915--1805 B.C.) Book of Genesis written (c. 1446--1406 B.C.) Genesis A U T H O R , P L A C E A N D DAT E O F W R I T I N G Genesis is, strictly speaking, an anonymous work. Historical tradition, however, as well as Biblical attestation, assigns authorship to Moses (see, e.g., Mk 12:26; Lk 24:27; Jn 1:45; Ro 10:5; 2Co 3:15). Moses� author ship would not have required him to write the entire book. In fact, all of the Genesis events took place long before Moses was born, indicating that he must have used sources.We might view Moses as an editor/historian who, in addition to receiving God&#39;s direct and supernatural communication, drew together details of the family histories of Abraham and his descendants, as they existed in the Israelite community in Egypt, into a single text. Scholars who question Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch (Ge--Dt) generally support one or another variant of the Documentary Hypothesis (see &#39;The Documentary Hypothesis&#39; on p. 15). If Moses did indeed write/compile Genesis, he must have done so during the Israelites&#39; exodus wandering period, probably between 1440 and 1400 B.C. (see &#39;The Store Cities of Pithom and Rameses&#39; on p. 86, &#39;The Pharaoh of the Exodus&#39; on p. 98, &#39;The Date of the Exodus&#39; on p. 106, &#39;The Hyksos and the Old Testament&#39; on p. 121 and &#39;The Conquest of Canaan&#39; on p. 310). Those scholars who suggest that the Pentateuch was written as a single work during the exile typically place the date of authorship at about 550 B.C. A U D I E N C E Genesis records the stories of the creation, the fall into sin, the flood, the call of Abraham and the early history of the ancestors of Israel. The Genesis stories were probably circulated among the Israelites living in Egypt, reminding them of their familial and spiritual heritage and explaining their current situation. Genesis preserved individual stories (like those about Joseph) that could afford hope to God&#39;s enslaved people. Promises to Abraham about the future of his progeny (e.g., 15:1--7) also would have encouraged them. Later, Israelites directly involved in the exodus, as well as their succeeding generations, no doubt read Genesis in order to understand this piece of the great saga of their national origin. The fulfillment of God&#39;s historical promises to the patriarchs served as a testimony to his continuing faithfulness. C U LT U R A L FA C T S A N D H I G H L I G H T S Genesis records the birth and early history of humankind. Not only did God create the physical world, but he also formed man and woman in his own image and endowed them with the gift of free will. Over time changes took place, including humanity&#39;s fall into sin and the resultant great flood. Tribes, cities and civilizations ebbed and flowed, rising and declining in a rhythm that has characterized human history ever since. Centuries passed, and at some point God chose to concentrate his particular attention on one individual from an ordinary, idol-worshiping family---who in his turn opted to listen and obey. From such unimpressive roots began the triumphant---if often temporarily tragic--- saga of redemption history. T I M E L I N E INTRODUCTION TO G E N E S I S 3 A S Y O U R E A D Note how quickly and irreversibly the human race turned its back on Eden and on perfect fellowship with God (chs. 2--3) and how God responded (chs. 4--8). Then, through the unlikely choice of a still-childless patriarch, God began to form the family from which the Israelite nation would spring (chs. 11--30; 49). Study the life of Joseph, from his years of slavery to his meteoric rise to power in a strange land to his revelation to his unsuspecting brothers (chs. 42--45). This book explains how and why the Israelites came to live in Egypt, setting the stage for what would happen to this special people in Exodus and beyond. D I D Y O U K N O W ? * An individual in the ancient Near East could claim rights to a well on someone else&#39;s land (21:25--30). * The bride price paid by a husband&#39;s family was to be held in trust to provide for the wife if she were to find herself abandoned or widowed (31:14--16). * A man&#39;s seal, cord and staff were symbols of his individual and corporate identity---the ancient equivalent of an I.D. card or signature (38:17--18). * Both the Egyptians and the Babylonians compiled &#39;dream books,&#39; containing sample dreams with keys to their interpretation (40:8). * The philosophy behind the Egyptian practice of embalming was a belief that the body was to be preserved as a repository for the soul after death (50:2--3).</p><h2>Woodworking Techniques (Essentials of Woodworking)</h2><p>Woodworking Techniques brings together the best articles on the construction techniques necessary for both amateurs and pros to assemble, decorate, and complete fine furniture.

The part of Kentucky that skirts West Virginia and Tennessee is, O'Brien says, a region of poverty, bluegrass, and country soul, where crime--even murder--is a major activity. Here, he focuses on the ten-year criminal career of two of the region's inhabitants- -former prison-guard Sherry Sheets Pelfrey Wong Hodge and her husband, lifetime criminal Benny Hodge--who, in 1985, formed part of a gang that stole a local doctor's hoard of nearly $2 million cash, killing his daughter in the process. In O'Brien's expert hands, the slow, handsome, enormously powerful Benny and his tough- minded, quick-thinking, coolheaded wife are totally believable, even sympathetic, products of lives impoverished at every level. Also fascinating are the Hodges' lawyer, Lester Burns--who, already rich but unable to resist accepting a fee in money he knew was stolen, bragged about his illicit payoff to an undercover FBI agent; the classically corrupt sheriff, who hired Hodge (as a cook) and then sought to blackmail him into various crimes; car-crazy middle-class sleaze Roger Epperson, perfectly qualified to be the brains behind the heist--he'd already been involved in the murder of his father's best friend; and police lieutenant Danny Webb, who tracked the gang down with the help of a fingerprint on an attach&#x201a; case they'd left behind. The smell of wet, coal-laden earth, white lightening, and cocaine-driven sweat rises from these marvelously atmospheric--and compelling--pages.

Mary Ann Esposito's <i>Ciao Italia in Umbria</i> meets this dearth handily. A "traveling cookbook," it showcases the region's healthy, rustic food while providing a first-person look at its restaurants, home cooks, and singular occupations, like truffle hunting. The core of the book--an offshoot of Esposito's PBS series <i>Ciao Italia</i>--is its 60 easy-to-do recipes, which feature the area's most notable and delicious products, including olive oil, black truffles, farro, and wine. If the relatively few formulas provided leave readers hungry for more, those offered, such as Carp with Rosemary and Fennel and Fava Beans with Olive Oil and Pecorino Cheese, couldn't be more inviting.<p>The recipes grow from Esposito's narratives. For example, her truffle hunt chapter yields the traditional Penne with Truffles and Cream as well as the more singular Veal with Black Truffle and Strawberry Sauce. Similarly, a section on local female chefs leads to two unusual gnocchi recipes--prune- and zucchini-filled--while one on Umbrian flatbreads offers formulas for oil-fried brustengo, spinach-filled torta sul testo, and a luscious prosciutto pie. Seafood is well represented, as are recipes for the pork delicacies of Norcia, including the delicious Sweet Pork Sausages with Grapes. Readers will also enjoy making sweets like Chocolate Spumone, exemplary strufoli (honey balls), and addictive mezzalune, almond crescent cookies. With an "address book" of outstanding Umbrian restaurants, the book provides a compelling culinary tour of a region too often neglected by cookbooks but, happily, celebrated here. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>Mary Ann Esposito is the host of the public television series "Ciao Italia," now in its twelfth season.

His other books include <i>River God, Warlock, The Seventh Scroll</i><i>,</i> and <i>The Sunbird</i>. His books are now translated into twenty-six languages and have sold over 120 million copies. Smith was born to a British family in Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia, in Central Africa, and attended Rhodes University in South Africa. He has homes in Cape Town, London, Switzerland, and Malta.London security expert Hector Cross, now married to Hazel Bannock (seventh on Forbes magazine's list of the richest women in the world), continues his battle with Somali warlord Tippoo Tip in bestseller Smith's lurid sequel to 2011's Those in Peril. Early on, a Mercedes van driven by a man wearing a Richard Nixon mask deliberately broadsides the red Ferrari that Hazel is driving on her way home to Brandon Hall, the couple's 18th-century estate outside Winchester. After extensive sleuthing and a long backstory set in a prison, Hector tracks down the perpetrators of the attack to a hilltop fortress in tiny Kazundu, the poorest country on the African continent. Readers, especially new ones, should be prepared for descriptions of death in all its many gory possibilities, as well as scenes of rape (both hetero- and homosexual), child molestation, sexual slavery, and torture. The exciting action scenes and larger-than-life characters, though, will appeal to a broad range of thriller fans. Agent: Kevin Conroy Scott, Tibor Jones &amp; Associates.

The result was the landmark publication <i>Changing New York</i>, a milestone in the history of photography that stands as an indispensable record of the Depression-era city.<br>More than sixty years later, New York is an even denser city of steel-and-glass and restless energy. Guided by Abbott's voice and vision, New York photographer Douglas Levere has revisited the sites of 100 of Abbott's photographs, meticulously duplicating her compositions with exacting detail; each shot is taken at the same time of day, at the same time of year, and with the same type of camera. <i>New York Changing</i> pairs Levere's and Abbott's images, resulting in a remarkable commentary on the evolution of a metropolis known for constantly reinventing itself.</p><p>Douglas Levere is a New York-based photographer whose works have been published in Newsweek , Business Week , Forbes , and People .Real progress is something that needn&#x2019;t be commented on; it is simply self-evident. That&#x2019;s the principle behind this elegantly understated book, which places photographs taken by photographer Berenice Abbott in the mid-1930s alongside present-day photos of the same locations shot by Douglas Levere, whose work has appeared in such magazines as Forbes and People. In some cases, the contemporary images are remarkably similar to the Depression-era ones; take, for instance, the New York Telephone Building, which, aside from a new name (Verizon Communications Building), seems unchanged by time. Others are utterly different. In 1937, the Wanamaker&#x2019;s department store occupied the corner of Broadway and east 9th Street, and its fa�ade was covered in billboards; today, a 15-story apartment building and diner stand in that same space. Some duos are similar, but with one altered element&#x2014;like the absence, in 2002, of an elevated railroad track blazing through Herald Square, as it did in 1936. It&#x2019;s clear that Levere took care to re-shoot the photos from virtually the same angles that Abbott used&#x2014;which is much easier said than done. The text that accompanies each pair of photos underlies the difficulty of Levere&#x2019;s task. For a photo depicting Fifth Avenue shoppers dashing around, Levere had to rent a double-decker bus, but since he couldn&#x2019;t get permission from the city to stop in traffic, "the bus driver feigned an emergency, placing orange cones on the road and opening the bus hood to allow Levere to take his photograph at precisely 1:10 P.M." This is exactly the kind of scrupulous attention to detail that makes this book work so well. 170 duotone photos.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Burrough delves deeply into the personal and professional lives of the 11 people who lived aboard Mir from 1995 to 1998. What we soon discover is simultaneously disheartening and fascinating: the men and women who would be astronauts must run a gauntlet of hazings, are judged professionally on their personal lives, and win flight assignments through serendipity as often as through hard work. NASA is controlled by cliques and cults of personality: "People don't speak out, because George makes short work of you if you do.... If you get on his bad side, you won't get a flight assignment...." There are "issues dealing with training and the selection of crews that you don't dare speak up about." The down-to-the-last-bolt descriptions of life aboard the station, from what the air smells like to an explanation of "penguin suits" to the distance between the dinner table and the original, now seldom-used toilet--2 feet--will thrill space enthusiasts. Space may not be "where no man has gone before" anymore, but it nevertheless provides endless dream fodder for those of us left behind on Earth. <i>--Jhana Bach</i>Bryan Burrough is a special correspondent at <i>Vanity Fair</i> magazine in New York.

Baillie, this directory of watchmakers and clock makers of the past soon established itself as the standard reference source and has been used ever since by watchmakers and clockmakers, collectors, dealers, museums, historians, and libraries the world over. The list of makers has more than doubled, having been thoroughly updated and revised by Brian Loomes in this twenty-first century edition, and now contains information on about 90,000 makers working between the late&nbsp;16th and early&nbsp;20th centuries. As well as the makers and retailers of clocks and watches, the list includes makers of scientific instruments, sundials, and barometers. Working dates include dates and places of birth, apprenticeship, freedom, marriage and death, as well as movement between different locations, and monograms. It is a unique and essential work of reference.</p><p>The late G.H. Baillie was a consulting engineer who was absorbed by the history and science of horology. He was a pioneer in compiling and publishing facts about past clockmakers and watchmakers. At one time he employed several people to uncover new details about them from various municipal archives, especially in Europe. Brian Loomes is today&#39;s best-known and most widely published author in the field of British antique clocks. He has written hundreds of articles and twenty-two books on the subject, including several which are used as standard works for collectors, dealers, museums and researchers throughout the world.

Tour.</p><p>Dorothy Allison is the acclaimed author of the nationally bestselling novel <b>Bastard Out of Carolina</b>, which was a finalist for the 1992 National Book Award. The recipient of numerous awards, she lives in Northern California.Allison's much-praised novel Bastard Out of Carolina was inspired by her childhood in Greenville, S.C., but in this memoir, adapted from a performance piece, she cuts even closer to the bone. "We don't have a family Bible?" the author's fourth-grade self asks her aunt. "Child, some days we don't even have a family," comes the response. If Allison suffered horrors, notably rape by her stepfather when she was five, she has transmuted pain into stories, gaining control with maturity. Indeed, her title prefaces several hard-won aphorisms she uses to counterpoint her memories: "No one is as hard as my uncles had to pretend to be." Her mother was a beauty, as was her sister, but Dorothy, smart and plain, felt a legacy of ugliness, one she shook off slowly as her feminism and her heart led her to lesbian relationships, often painful, finally rewarding. She is now, in her 40s, a new mother, and her stories?and life?are a triumph of love over cruelty. Read it aloud and savor the rhythms. Photos not seen by PW.

But something can be gained, too, in the hearing, and Neruda's language, so subtle but accessible, lends itself gracefully to the treatment.

For more information, please go to GilbertKing.comFor Mabel Norris Reese, Wednesdays had a special routine. Wednesday was the day the <i>Mount Dora Topic</i>, the weekly newspaper that she and her husband, Paul, owned and ran, went to press. The alarm clock would go off at four a.m. in their house on Morningside Drive in Sylvan Shores, a small, upscale community of Mediterranean Revival and ranch homes along the west side of Lake Gertrude. Within the hour, Mabel would be barreling along the few miles to the <i>Topic</i>&#x2019;s office in downtown Mount Dora. There she&#x2019;d go over that week&#x2019;s edition, making corrections in the lead galleys, before heading back home to cook break�fast for Paul and their daughter, Patricia. <br><br> Once Patricia had been seen off to school, Mabel would return to the office with Paul for the long hours ahead. Side by side, they would dress up the pages of the newspaper together. Harold Rawley, who ran the Linotype machine, would set the pages one metal line of type at a time, to be inked and printed later that night on the Old Topper, the <i>Topic</i>&#x2019;s big press. Mrs. Downs, a seventy- two- year- old widow who had taken over the print work from her late husband, would stand in the hot air atop the press platform, feeding sheets of paper into the jaws of the loud, cranky machine that birthed the &#x201c;inky babies,&#x201d; as Mabel called them.<br><br> Sturdy and still stylish at forty- three, Mabel favored printed cotton shirtwaist dresses, which she sometimes wore with pearls, and with her bebopper&#x2019;s cat- eye glasses she was easily spotted out and about in old- fashioned Mount Dora. In addition to covering meetings, writing stories and weekly editori�als, taking photographs, and selling ads, Mabel worked the arm on the wing mailer and slapped name stickers on each freshly printed copy un�til, as she liked to tell Patricia, &#x201c;the pile on the left goes way down and the pile on the right climbs to a mountain.&#x201d; (Patricia herself attended to the wrapping and stamping of the papers, and Paul and his brother deliv�ered the lot of them to the post office.)<br><br> Mabel had performed this strenuous Wednesday routine more than five hundred times in the ten years that she and Paul had been publishing the <i>Topic</i>. She&#x2019;d missed only two issues&#x2014; once when she&#x2019;d been briefly hospitalized and once the previous summer, when she&#x2019;d traveled to Illi�nois to accept a journalism award. But when, in the wee hours of December 18, rumors of a white woman&#x2019;s rape began to circulate, Mabel deviated from her normal Wednesday routine and instead followed her reportorial instincts. They took her to Okahumpka, where she&#x2019;d heard that residents of North Quarters were being harassed. There she found that Sheriff McCall&#x2019;s deputies were not only terrorizing the residents but also arresting on suspicion virtually every young black male in the neighborhood. One of them described how Negro suspects were being rounded up and taken in by up to five carloads at a time. &#x201c;They woke me up at two a.m. and told me I would get the electric chair if they didn&#x2019;t kill me beforehand,&#x201d; he said. Another Okahumpka resident told Mabel, &#x201c;They took in thirty- three of our menfolk. Not just men, but boys, too . . . A body couldn&#x2019;t do anything but wait for &#x2019;em to come pounding on the door.&#x201d; <br><br> By daybreak, Mabel had pages of notes to transcribe, and they reverberated with fear&#x2014; fear that, once again, the Lake County Sheriff&#x2019;s Department was indiscriminately rounding up young black men, and that, once again, violence would come of it. &#x201c;A restlessness began to run through the quarters,&#x201d; Mabel wrote, &#x201c;and it mounted steadily.&#x201d;</p><h2>Enemy at the gates: The battle for Stalingrad</h2><p>Craig, William, Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad</p><p>William Craig was a native of Concord, Massachusetts.

Indeed, from Indonesian sweatshops to oil-based violence in Nigeria, the challenges of regulating harmful corporate practices in some of the world&#x2019;s most difficult regions long seemed insurmountable. Human rights groups and businesses were locked in a stalemate, unable to find common ground. In 2005, the United Nations appointed John Gerard Ruggie to the modest task of clarifying the main issues. Six years later, he had accomplished much more than that. Ruggie had developed his now-famous "Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights," which provided a road map for ensuring responsible global corporate practices. The principles were unanimously endorsed by the UN and embraced and implemented by other international bodies, businesses, governments, workers&#x2019; organizations, and human rights groups, keying a revolution in corporate social responsibility. <p><em>Just Business</em> tells the powerful story of how these landmark &#x201c;Ruggie Rules&#x201d; came to exist. Ruggie demonstrates how, to solve a seemingly unsolvable problem, he had to abandon many widespread and long-held understandings about the relationships between businesses, governments, rights, and law, and develop fresh ways of viewing the issues. He also takes us through the journey of assembling the right type of team, of witnessing the severity of the problem firsthand, and of pressing through the many obstacles such a daunting endeavor faced.</p><p><em>Just Business</em> is an illuminating inside look at one of the most important human rights developments of recent times. It is also an invaluable book for anyone wanting to learn how to navigate the tricky processes of global problem-solving and consensus-building and how to tackle big issues with ambition, pragmatism, perseverance, and creativity.</p></p><p>John Ruggie is the Berthold Beitz Professor in Human Rights and International Affairs at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.By developing the 'UN Guiding Principles, ' John Ruggie brought thoughtful and principled pragmatism to a topic of decades-long controversy.

However, there was no universally accepted framework to address or reduce corporate-related human rights harm. John Ruggie took up the challenge to fill that gap and achieved a great deal in a short space of time. It is all too easy when looking at seemingly intractable problems to believe that nothing can be done or that only governments or political leaders can act. Just Business shows us the opposite and underlines how all segments of society must play their part to achieve results that benefit all. --Kofi Annan, United Nations Secretary-General (1997-2006)"<br><br>Ruggie provides a shining example to leaders that apparently insurmountable global issues are not lost causes.

Lewis In A Time Of War</h2><p>A behind-the-scenes look at the four remarkable BBC radio broadcasts during World War II that became Lewis&#x2019;s classic Mere Christianity.</p><p>C. S. Lewis is universally recognized as one of the intellectual giants of the twentieth century. Despite his sophistication, Lewis was able to reach a vast popular audience during his lifetime and continues to attract thousands of new readers every year. But when during the most desperate years of World War II he was asked by the BBC&#x2019;s Home Service to give radio addresses about Christianity, he was dismissed by critics as a layman who was unqualified to tackle such weighty issues. To the annoyance of some of his colleagues at Oxford Lewis proved to be enormously persuasive, and his talks were eventually published as Mere Christianity, which ranks as one of the great classics of religious literature.<br> <br> BBC journalist Justin Phillips&#x2019;s C. S. Lewis Goes to War is a fascinating look at a how these talks were created and the enthusiastic response they generated at a time when bombing in London caused many radio stations to be evacuated. This book reveals a previously untapped and rich vein of Lewis&#x2019;s life and work that will intrigue his millions of fans.Justin Phillips was a radio journalist for the BBC for over twenty years. He worked in the World Service and was deputy editor of The World Tonight. Phillips was an elder at his local church and a frequent speaker and preacher about Christianity, the media, and the relationship between the two. His faith, work, and life were finely intertwined. Phillips died in 2000 just before his fiftieth birthday soon after submitting this finished manuscript. His oldest daughter, Laura Treneer, acted as his editor and brought the manuscript forward to publication.</p><h2>The Clarke Tin Whistle Book (Penny &amp; Tin Whistle)</h2><p>Compatible with all types of tin whistles, pennywhistles, and flageolets.

The series is full of respect for the landscape and the hard work it takes to survive in the far north. Now she starts a new series starring Liam Campbell, an Alaskan State Trooper with a troubled past and an uncertain future; the environmental issues of the 1980s appear to have been back-burnered in favor of the personal needs and feelings of the 1990s.<p> You might think there are one too many colorful eccentrics or jaunty drunks in the town of Newenham, where former Sergeant Campbell has been demoted after his own bout with booze and self-doubt. But you'll definitely admire the way Stabenow jumpstarts her story: within a few minutes of his arrival from Anchorage, Campbell has to deal with one murder (a pilot almost decapitated by his propeller), one old girlfriend (the exotic and possibly dangerous Wy Chouinard), and a man held hostage in the town's only decent burger joint--held for shooting out a jukebox that was playing Jimmy Buffet's <i>Margaritaville</i>.</p><p> Stabenow can also grab your attention with the details of everyday life in an Alaskan fishing village, such as this description of the contents of a light plane: "There was a handful of candy wrappers, two maps of Bristol Bay, five small green glass balls which Liam recognized as Japanese fishing floats, a walrus tusk broken off near the root, a survival kit, two firestarter logs, two parkas, two pairs of boots, a litre-sized plastic Pepsi bottle half full of yellow liquid, a clam gun, a bucket, three mismatched gloves and three handheld radios, which to Liam seemed a bit redundant." The Kate Shugak books include <i>A Cold Day for Murder</i>, <i>Breakup</i>, <i>A Cold-Blooded Business</i>, <i>Blood Will Tell</i>, <i>Dead in the Water</i>, <i>A Fatal Thaw</i>, <i>Killing Grounds</i>, and <i>Play with Fire</i>. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>Dana Stabenow was born in Anchorage and raised on a 75-foot fish tender in the Gulf of Alaska. She knew there was a warmer, drier job out there somewhere and found it in writing. Her first crime fiction novel, A Cold Day for Murder, won an Edgar award. Her first thriller, Blindfold Game, hit the New York Times bestseller list.</p><h2>Joyful Stitching Book</h2><p>Dive into Laura&#39;s delightful world of embroidery and learn how to create small, free-form embroidery pieces that are alive with color and texture. With instructions for 21 embroidery stitches and 6 projects, all in Laura&#39;s signature colorful, whimsical style, you&#39;ll transform a flat, plain surface into a joyful, design-packed art piece. Stitch on wool, felt, or silk, and enjoy the simple pleasure of slow stitching. Includes a gallery of display ideas.</p><p>Laura Wasilowski&#39;s current flame is the art quilt. This latest love is a marriage of fabric, color, hand embroidery, and whimsy that she truly enjoys. Laura Lives in Elgin, Illinois, where she hand dyes fabric and threads for her business, Artfabrik.This is the ideal book for anybody who thinks that embroidery is too &#34;quiet&#34; for them. Perhaps it conjures up images of florals and practical items such as tea towels? As it says on the cover with this book you can learn how to &#34;transform fabric with improvisational embroidery&#34; and have a lot of fun in the process. As soon as I saw the bright, folk art inspired image of a bird on the cover it made me want to start stitching. As the author says in her introduction you can really bring fabric to life with embroidery and the projects in here all demonstrate this. Most books on freestyle embroidery use 6-strand floss on cotton or linen, but this one uses perle thread on silk, wool and felt. The author also uses a lot of variegated skeins which adds a lot of the liveliness and also omits having to buy a very large number of shades of each color. The book starts with a brief overview as well as a section on what you need and how to use it. This includes how to use perle thread, methods of transferring designs to silk, wool and felt and buying the right needles and fabric. Each stitch is then shown in several good sized captioned photographs; these are easy to follow and I like the contrast between thread and fabric. Stitches are listed alphabetically and comprise all the basic freestyle stitches plus a few useful extras. The rest of the book contains the six projects which are wonderfully bright depictions of an apple, bird, heart filled with flowers, stylized plants, hand of fortune and a landscape with a house and lake. Each project covers several pages and contains a fair number of captioned photographs, list of what you need complete with a photograph of the threads plus instructions on finishing. The projects are pictures rather than functional items to be enjoyed as they are. US embroiderers can buy the variegated threads, hand dyed fabrics and even kits of the projects in the author&#39;s online store; those in other countries will need to look elsewhere. This aside I found this to be a beautiful and inspiring book, ideal for anybody of any level who wants to see where freestyle embroidery can take them. -- Rachel Hyde * myshelf.com *</p><h2>Self-Knowledge &amp; Self-Discipline</h2><p>This is a pre-1923 historical reproduction that was curated for quality.

Now, thirteen of today's leading critics and historians challenge and redefine conventional assumptions in a highly original and revealing series of essays that focus on artist and writer couples who have shared both sexual and artistic bonds, combining biography with evaluation of each partner's work in the context of their relationship.<br>Significant Others features such celebrated duos as Camille Claudel and Auguste Rodin, Sonia and Robert Delaunay, Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West, Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, Anais Nin and Henry Miller, and Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg. The contributors explore the nature of artistic companionships, with their corresponding limitations and innovations; the tangled questions of identity; the roles of gender and sexuality; and the stereotypes imposed by society. Many of the essays are particularly concerned with the way women and men have been evaluated in relation to their partners in traditional biographies, art history and literary criticism. We are encouraged to think in new ways about inspirational interaction, and to reassess both women's and men's contributions to culture and the importance of their art.<br>These creative unions offer arresting instances of sexual and artistic collision, collusion and mutual stimulation. Significant Others presents thirteen dramas, with imaginative and courageous players who chose fruitful, colorful and often difficult solutions to the dilemmas of social constraint and competing genius.</p><p>Essentially gossip--in spite of the trendy title--in these 13 essays by various authors on the influence that sexually paired writers or artists have on each other. Chadwick also examined the issue of gender and creativity in Women, Art, and Society (1990) with the same superficial and fragmented results. How to reconcile the solitude that creativity requires with the love that artists crave? In these pieces, creativity becomes incidental. Instead, there are tales of monumental disorder, power struggles, madness and suicide, emotional chaos, and intense and often deviant political and sexual lives--all giving the clear message that creative people inflict immense damage on those who dare to love them. Marriage is rare, and adultery and sexual experimentation commonplace. Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant (Lisa Tickner), Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West (Louise de Salvo), and Ana&#x2039;s Nin and Henry Miller (Noel Riley Fitch) are the most familiar couples. Chadwick offers one successful pairing in Sonia Delaunay and her husband, Robert, a painter whose theory of simultaneity Sonia translated into fashion design. And there's a mutually enriching collaboration in the secret pairing of Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg (Jonathan Katz). Most pairings, however, display predictable inequities: Camille Claudel driven mad by Rodin (Anne Higonnet); Clara Malraux silenced by Andr&#x201a; (de Courtivron); and the literal possession of Jackson Pollock's life by his wife, Lee Krasner (Anne Wagner), the major informant for his biographers. And however romanticized and sanitized, Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera (Hayden Herrera) and Lillian Hellman and Dashiell Hammett (Bernard Benstock) still appear savage, disturbed, self- destructive, and power-hungry. A collection that raises questions not so much about pairing or even creativity, but rather about how people living such chaotic lives function at all--and about why those who enjoy their art should care about their sexual logistics. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Known as Bertie, and the eldest son of Victoria and Albert, he was bullied by both his parents.<br>&nbsp;<br>His mother, Queen Victoria, the first and most powerful woman in his life, blamed Bertie's scandalous womanising for his father's early demise. Although Bertie was heir to the throne, she refused to give him any proper responsibilities, as a result of which he spent his time eating (his waist measurement was 48 inches and his nickname was 'Edward the Wide'), betting on race-horses and shooting grouse. He was married off to Alexandra of Denmark, who was beautiful but infantile, lavishing her affection on her doggies and pet bunnies.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bertie's numerous mistresses included the society hostess Daisy Brook ('Babbling Brook') and the gorgeous but fragile Lillie Langtry (with whom 'played house' in a specially built hide-away home). The last of the women in his life was the clever and manipulative Alice Keppel. He always placed her at dinner next to his most important guests, because of her grasp of politics, her brilliant conversation and her formidable skills at the Bridge table.<br>&nbsp;<br>When Bertie finally became king, he did a good job, especially in foreign policy. This colourful book gives him due credit, while painting a vivid portrait of the age in all its excess and eccentricity, hypocrisy and heartbreak.</p><p>JANE RIDLEY is an historian at Buckingham University where she teaches a course on biography.

In 1942, with Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, they and another family lived cloistered in the &#34;Secret Annex&#34; of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and amusing, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.</p><p>A beloved classic since its initial publication in 1947, this vivid, insightful journal is a fitting memorial to the gifted Jewish teenager who died at Bergen-Belsen, Germany, in 1945. Born in 1929, Anne Frank received a blank diary on her 13th birthday, just weeks before she and her family went into hiding in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam. Her marvelously detailed, engagingly personal entries chronicle 25 trying months of claustrophobic, quarrelsome intimacy with her parents, sister, a second family, and a middle-aged dentist who has little tolerance for Anne's vivacity. The diary's universal appeal stems from its riveting blend of the grubby particulars of life during wartime (scant, bad food; shabby, outgrown clothes that can't be replaced; constant fear of discovery) and candid discussion of emotions familiar to every adolescent (everyone criticizes me, no one sees my real nature, when will I be loved?). Yet Frank was no ordinary teen: the later entries reveal a sense of compassion and a spiritual depth remarkable in a girl barely 15. Her death epitomizes the madness of the Holocaust, but for the millions who meet Anne through her diary, it is also a very individual loss. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>For almost fifty years, Anne Frank&#39;s diary has moved millions with its testament to the human spirit&#39;s indestructibility, but readers have never seen the full text of this beloved book--until now. This new translation, performed by Winona Ryder, restores nearly one third of Anne&#39;s entries excised by her father in previous editions, revealing her burgeoning sexuality, her stormy relationship with her mother, and more.</p><h2>Through the Window of Life</h2><p>As the world moves closer to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, it seems that the whole earth is in turmoil.

How will that occur, and where will that happen? In 1999, Suzanne Freeman briefly passed away during surgery before returning to mortality.

He suggests that rather than focusing on ineffective solutions that will cost us trillions of dollars over the coming decades, we should be looking for smarter, more cost-effective approaches (such as massively increasing our commitment to green energy R&amp;D) that will allow us to deal not only with climate change but also with other pressing global concerns, such as malaria and HIV/AIDS. And he considers why and how this debate has fostered an atmosphere in which dissenters are immediately demonized.</p></p><p><b>Amazon.com Guest Reviewer: Michael Crichton</b><br> In his many science-themed bestsellers--including <i>The Andromeda Strain</i>, <i>Jurassic Park</i>, <i>Prey</i>, and most recently, <i>Next</i>--Michael Crichton has covered everything from genetically engineered dinosaurs to time travel to nantechnology run amok. Having cast his own views on the dangers and hysteria surrounding global warming with <i>State of Fear</i>, he turns his pen toward the often controversial Bj�rn Lomborg and his latest book, <i>Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming</i>. <br><br> <br><br> Bj�rn Lomborg is the best-informed and most humane advocate for environmental change in the world today. In contrast to other figures that promote a single issue while ignoring others, Lomborg views the globe as a whole, studies all the problems we face, ranks them, and determines how best, and in what order, we should address them. His first book, <i>The Skeptical Environmentalist</i>, established the importance of a fact-based approach. With later books, <i>Global Crises, Global Solutions</i> and <i>How to Spend $50 Billion to Make the World a Better Place</i>, this mild-mannered Danish statistician has steadily gained new converts. Not surprisingly, <i>Time</i> Magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world. <p></p> <i>Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming</i> will further enhance Lomborg&#x2019;s reputation for global analysis and thoughtful response. For anyone who wants an overview of the global warming debate from an objective source, this brief text is a perfect place to start. Lomborg is only interested in real problems, and he has no patience with media fear-mongering; he begins by dispatching the myth of the endangered polar bears, showing that this Disneyesque cartoon has no relevance to the real world where polar bear populations are in fact increasing. Lomborg considers the issue in detail, citing sources from Al Gore to the World Wildlife Fund, then demonstrating that polar bear populations have actually increased five fold since the 1960s. <p></p> Lomborg then works his way through the concerns we hear so much about: higher temperatures, heat deaths, species extinctions, the cost of cutting carbon, the technology to do it. Lomborg believes firmly in climate change--despite his critics, he's no denier--but his fact-based approach, grounded in economic analyses, leads him again and again to a different view. He reviews published estimates of the cost of climate change, and the cost of addressing it, and concludes that "we actually end up paying more for a partial solution than the cost of the entire problem. That is a bad deal." <p></p> In some of the most disturbing chapters, Lomborg recounts what leading climate figures have said about anyone who questions the orthodoxy, thus demonstrating the illiberal, antidemocratic tone of the current debate. Lomborg himself takes the larger view, explaining in detail why the tone of hysteria is inappropriate to addressing the problems we face. <p></p> In the end, Lomborg&#x2019;s concerns embrace the planet. He contrasts our concern for climate with other concerns such as HIV/AIDS, malnutrition, and providing clean water to the world. In the end, his ability to put climate in a global perspective is perhaps the book&#x2019;s greatest value. Lomborg and <i>Cool It</i> are our best guides to our shared environmental future. <p></p> --Michael Crichton <p></p> (photo credit: Jonathan Exley) <br><br><p><b>Bjorn Lomborg </b>is the author of <i>The Skeptical Environmentalist</i> and has written for numerous publications, including <i>The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal,</i> <i>The Economist,</i> and <i>USA Today.</i> He was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by <i>Time</i> magazine in 2004.

She made a 94 percent on a math test, and she accepted a movie date for later in the week.</p><p>She walked home, as usual. She didn&#x2019;t use her hearing device since she didn&#x2019;t really need it outside of school. This gadget had the appearance of an iPod, but it didn&#x2019;t play music. Instead it played a form of static that removed from Hannah&#x2019;s hearing the disjointed thoughts of other people. Since babyhood, she&#x2019;d heard these broken thoughts of others, which she&#x2019;d learned to call whispers. But they came into her head like a badly tuned radio; she could never tell exactly who the whisperer was if more than one person was present; and they made school a nightmare for her. So a mechanism that her mom called an AUD box had been manufactured for Hannah. She&#x2019;d worn it since she was seven years old.</p><p>When she arrived home, she went to the stairs. She headed up to her room, only to see her stepfather come stealthily out of it.</p><p>They locked eyes. <i>Damn&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what&#x2019;s she doing&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. why didn&#x2019;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </i>came into Hannah&#x2019;s head from Jeff Corrie as whispers always did, disconnected and seemingly random. She frowned as she heard them, and she wondered what her stepfather had been doing in her room besides trying once again to gather reassurance that she wasn&#x2019;t going to tell her mother how she&#x2019;d been helping him with his latest scheme.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t as if she&#x2019;d wanted to help him, either. But Jeff Corrie had Hannah&#x2019;s mom in some sort of thrall that had more to do with his looks than his character, and caught up in their dizzying relationship, she&#x2019;d told him what went on inside Hannah&#x2019;s head when she wasn&#x2019;t wearing the AUD box. It hadn&#x2019;t taken him long to figure out a way to use Hannah&#x2019;s talent. He decided to &#x201c;employ&#x201d; her as the cake and coffee girl at his investment house, just the person to bring in the refreshments and listen to the whispers of his clients in order to read their weaknesses. He and his pal Connor separated old folks from their money in this way. It was a grand scheme and it was making them millions.</p><p>Hannah had never wanted to help him. She knew it was wrong. But she feared this man and she feared the fact that his whispers, his words, and the expressions on his face never matched up. She didn&#x2019;t know what this meant. But she knew it wasn&#x2019;t good. So she said nothing to anyone. She just did what she was told and waited for whatever was going to happen next. She had no idea it would happen that very afternoon.</p><p>Jeff Corrie said, &#x201c;What&#x2019;re you doing home?&#x201d; His gaze went to her right ear where the earphone to the AUD box usually was.</p><p>Hannah dug the box out of her pocket and clipped it on the waistband of her jeans, screwing the earphone into her ear as well. His eyes narrowed till he saw her turn up the volume. Then he seemed to relax.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s three thirty,&#x201d; she told him.</p><p>&#x201c;Start your homework,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>He went past her and down the stairs. She heard him yelling, &#x201c;Laurel? Where the hell are you? Hannah&#x2019;s home,&#x201d; as if his wife was supposed to do something about that.</p><p>Hannah put her backpack in her room. Everything seemed to be the way she&#x2019;d left it that morning. Still, she went to the bedside table to check the drawer.</p><p>The tiny piece of clear tape was ripped off. Someone had opened the drawer. Someone had read her journal.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t enough, she thought, that she helped him and his friend. He had to possess her thoughts on the matter, too. Well, good luck to figuring out how I feel, Daddy Jeff, Hannah scoffed. Like I&#x2019;d write something honest and actually leave it in my bedroom for you?</p><p>She left her room and descended the stairs. She heard her mom and Jeff Corrie talking in the kitchen. She joined them there and turned away from the sight of Jeff Corrie nuzzling her mother&#x2019;s neck. He was murmuring, &#x201c;What about n-o-w?&#x201d; and Laurel was laughing and playing at pushing him away. But Hannah knew her mom liked what was going on between her and her husband. She loved the guy, and her love was as deaf and as dumb as it was blind.</p><p>Hannah said, &#x201c;Hi, Mom,&#x201d; and opened the refrigerator, reaching for a carton of milk.</p><p>Laurel said, &#x201c;Hey. No hi to Jeff?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Already saw him upstairs,&#x201d; Hannah told her. She added, &#x201c;Gosh. He didn&#x2019;t tell you, Mom?&#x201d; just to see how she would react. Don&#x2019;t trust him, don&#x2019;t trust him, she wanted to say. But she could only plant seeds. She couldn&#x2019;t paint pictures.</p><p>There was a silence between Laurel and Jeff. With the refrigerator door still open, hiding her from them, Hannah turned off the volume of the AUD box.</p><p><i>He&#x2019;s not&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he can&#x2019;t be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. </i>had to be from her mother, she thought.</p><p>She tried to hear Jeff, but there was nothing.</p><p>Then everything changed, and life as Hannah had known it ended.</p><p><i>Little bitch always thinks&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a break-in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. surprise&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

She&#x2019;d lost money on the car, but money wasn&#x2019;t the issue. Getting away from San Diego along with getting rid of the Lexus was. She&#x2019;d traded it for a 1998 Jeep Wrangler, and the moment they&#x2019;d crossed the California state line into Oregon, she began looking for a place to unload the Jeep as well. A 1992 Toyota RAV4 came next. But that only took them up through Oregon to the border with Washington. As quickly as possible and making sure it was all legal, Laurel then dumped the Toyota for a 1988 Ford Explorer, which was what mother and daughter had driven ever since.</p><p>Becca hadn&#x2019;t questioned any of this. She&#x2019;d known the desperate reason it had to be done, just as she knew the reason there could be no more Hannah Armstrong. For she and her mother were traveling as fast as they could, leaving house, school, and names behind them. Now they sat in the Explorer in Mukilteo, Washington. The car was backed into a parking space in front of an old wooden-floored store called Woody&#x2019;s Market, across the water from Whidbey Island.</p><p>It was early evening, and a heavy mist that was not quite fog hung between the mainland and the island. From where they were parked, Whidbey was nothing more than an enormous hulk surmounted by tall conifers and having a band of lights at the bottom where a few houses were strung along the shore. To Becca, with an entire life lived in San Diego, the place looked forbidding and foreign. She couldn&#x2019;t imagine herself there, trying to establish a new life far away from her stepfather&#x2019;s reach. To Laurel, the island looked like a safety net where she could leave her daughter in the care of a childhood friend for the time it would take her to establish a place of refuge in British Columbia. There, she figured that she and Becca would be safe from discovery by Jeff Corrie.</p><p>Laurel had felt overwhelming relief when her longtime Bohemian lifestyle had been enough to quash any questions from her friend. Carol Quinn had not even acted surprised that Laurel would ask her to care for her daughter for a length of time she couldn&#x2019;t begin to name. Instead of questioning this, Carol said no problem, bring her on up, she can help me out. Haven&#x2019;t been feeling so great lately, Carol had said, so I could use an assistant in the house.</p><p>But will you keep this a secret? Laurel had asked her over and over again.</p><p>To my grave, Carol Quinn had promised. No worries, Laurel. Bring her on up.</p><p>Now Laurel lowered her window two inches, to keep the windshield from fogging up. The middle of September, and she hadn&#x2019;t had a clue the weather would have changed so much. In southern California, September was the hottest month of the year, a time of forest fires driven by winds off the desert. Here, it already felt like winter. Laurel shivered and grabbed a sweatshirt from the back of the car, where it lay against the wheel of Becca&#x2019;s old ten-speed.</p><p>She said, &#x201c;Cold?&#x201d; Becca shook her head. She was breathing deeply, and while she usually did this to calm herself, she was doing it now because on the air was the scent of waffle cones meant for ice cream, and it was coming from Woody&#x2019;s Market behind them.</p><p>They&#x2019;d already been inside. Becca had already asked for a cone. Laurel had already made the automatic reply of &#x201c;In through the lips and onto the hips.&#x201d; She was a woman who, on the run from a criminal, could still count her daughter&#x2019;s intake of calories. But Becca was hungry. They hadn&#x2019;t had anything to eat since lunch. A snack certainly wasn&#x2019;t going to blow up her thighs like balloons.</p><p>She said, &#x201c;Mom&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>Laurel turned to her. &#x201c;Tell me your name.&#x201d;</p><p>They&#x2019;d been through this exercise five times daily since leaving their home, so Becca wasn&#x2019;t happy to go through it another time. She understood the importance of it, but she wasn&#x2019;t an idiot. She&#x2019;d memorized it all. She sighed and looked in the other direction. &#x201c;Becca King,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;And what are you to remember as Job Number One?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Help Carol Quinn around the house.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aunt Carol,&#x201d; Laurel said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re to call her Aunt Carol.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aunt Carol, Aunt Carol, Aunt Carol,&#x201d; Becca said.</p><p>&#x201c;She knows you have a little money until I can start sending you more,&#x201d; Laurel said. &#x201c;But the more you can help her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It&#x2019;s like earning your keep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Becca said. &#x201c;I will become someone&#x2019;s slave because you married a maniac, Mom.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Oh God what did he do to you when you&#x2019;re my only&#x2014;</i></p><p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Becca said, hearing her mom&#x2019;s pain. &#x201c;Sorry. <i>Sorry</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Get out of my head,&#x201d; Laurel told her. &#x201c;And tell me your name. Full name this time.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a parking lot to Becca&#x2019;s right, across the main road that ended with the ferry dock. People had been sauntering from cars in that lot to a food stand just to one side of the dock. A sign declaring the place to be Ivar&#x2019;s<i> </i>was shining through the mist, and a line of people making purchases had formed. Becca&#x2019;s stomach growled.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me your name,&#x201d; Laurel repeated. &#x201c;This is important.&#x201d; Her voice was calm enough, but beneath the gentle tone was <i>come on come on there&#x2019;s so little time please do this for me it&#x2019;s the last thing I&#x2019;ll ask</i>,<i> </i>and Becca could feel those words coming at her, invading her brain, perfectly clear because that was how her mother&#x2019;s thoughts always were, unlike the whispers that came from others. She wanted to tell her mom not to worry. She wanted to tell her that Jeff Corrie might forget about them. But she knew the first statement was useless, and she knew the second was an outright lie.</p><p>Becca turned back to her mother and their eyes met and <i>listen my children and you shall hear of the midnight ride of Paul Revere</i> came from Laurel<i>.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Very funny,&#x201d; Becca said to her. &#x201c;It would&#x2019;ve been nice if you&#x2019;d memorized something else in sixth grade besides that, you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me your name,&#x201d; Laurel said again.</p><p>&#x201c;All right. All right. Rebecca Dolores King.&#x201d; Becca grimaced. &#x201c;God. Does it <i>have </i>to be Dolores? I mean, who has a name like Dolores these days?&#x201d;</p><p>Laurel ignored the question. &#x201c;Where are you from?&#x201d;</p><p>Becca said patiently because there was no point to anything other than patience at the moment, &#x201c;San Luis Obispo. Sun Valley, Idaho, before that. I was born in Sun Valley, but I left when I was seven and that&#x2019;s when my family moved to San Luis Obispo.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why are you here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m staying with my aunt.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where are your parents?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My mom&#x2019;s on a dig in&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Becca frowned. For the first time since they&#x2019;d fled California, she couldn&#x2019;t remember. She assumed it was the fact that she was so hungry because she was never at her best when there were physical needs that had to be taken care of. She said, &#x201c;Damn. I can&#x2019;t remember.&#x201d;</p><p>Laurel&#x2019;s head clunked back against the headrest of her seat. &#x201c;You <i>have </i>to remember. This is crucial. It&#x2019;s life and death. <i>Where </i>are your parents?&#x201d;</p><p>Becca looked at her mother, hoping for a clue but all she picked up was <i>on the eighteenth of April in seventy-five hardly a man is now alive</i>, which wasn&#x2019;t going to get her anywhere. She looked back at Ivar&#x2019;s. A woman bent over with osteoporosis was turning from the counter with a carton in her hand and she looked so old&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then it came to Becca. Old.</p><p>&#x201c;Olduvai Gorge,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;My mom&#x2019;s on a dig in Olduvai Gorge.&#x201d; Nothing could have been further from the truth, but shortly before they&#x2019;d made their run from Jeff Corrie, Becca had read an old book about the discovery of Lucy, aka <i>Australopithecus afarensis, </i>in Olduvai Gorge by an ambitious postgraduate fresh out of the University of Chicago. She&#x2019;d been the one to suggest that her mother be a paleontologist. It sounded romantic to her.</p><p>Laurel nodded, satisfied. &#x201c;What about your father? Where&#x2019;s your father? Don&#x2019;t you <i>have </i>a father?&#x201d;</p><p>Becca rolled her eyes. It was clear that this was going to go on till the ferry arrived because her mother wanted no time to think of anything else. Least of all did she want to think of how she&#x2019;d endangered her daughter. So Becca said deliberately, &#x201c;Which father would that be, Mom?&#x201d; and then she reached in her pocket and pulled out the single earphone of the AUD box. She shoved it into her ear. She turned up the volume and her head filled with static, soothing to her as always, the way satin is soothing against someone&#x2019;s skin.</p><p>Laurel reached over and yanked the earphone out of Becca&#x2019;s ear. She said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry this happened. I&#x2019;m sorry I&#x2019;m not who you want me to be. But here&#x2019;s the thing: no one ever is.&#x201d;</p><p>At this, Becca got out of the car. She had money enough in her jeans to buy herself something to eat, and more money in the pockets of her jacket. She fully intended to use it. There was even more money in her backpack if she wanted to buy everything on the menu, but the backpack was with her bike in the back of the Explorer and if she tried to get at it, she knew her mother would stop her.</p><p>Becca crossed the road. To her left, she could see the ferry coming, and she paused for a moment and watched its approach. When Laurel had first told her that she would get to Whidbey Island on a ferry, Becca had thought of the only ferry she&#x2019;d ever been on, an open-air raft that held four cars and sailed about two hundred yards across the harbor in Newport Beach, California. This thing approaching was nothing like that. It wa...</p></p><h2>Yu-Gi-Oh!: Duelist, Vol. 6 (6) (YU-GI-OH!

Lewis wrote, &#34;I have never concealed the fact that I regarded him as my master; indeed I fancy I have never written a book in which I did not quote from him.&#34; One day while in a train station, he picked up a copy of Phantastes and began to read. &#34;A few hours later,&#34; said Lewis, &#34;I knew I had crossed a great frontier.&#34; G.

Today, however, most of us work on computers, with access to hundreds of fonts, and we&#x2019;d all like our letters, reports and other documents to look as good and as readable as possible. But what does all the confusing terminology about ink traps, letter spacing, and visual centring mean, and what are the rules for good typography? Type Matters! is a book of tips for everyday use, for all users of typography, from students and professionals to anyone who does any layout design on a computer. The book is arranged into three chapters: an introduction to the basics of typography; headline and display type; and setting text. Within each chapter there are sections devoted to particular principles or problems, such as selecting the right typeface, leading, and the treatment of numbers. Examples throughout show precisely what makes good typography and, crucially, what doesn&#x2019;t. Authoritatively written and designed by a practitioner and teacher of typography, Type Matters! has a beautifully clear layout that reinforces the principles discussed throughout.</p><p>JIM WILLIAMS began his career as a typographer in advertising, and is now an award-winning graphic designer and a senior lecturer in graphics at Staffordshire University.<br><br>BEN CASEY is Creative Director of The Chase design consultancy and Professor of Visual Communication at the University of Central Lancashire.This book recalls the wise words of the great Jan Tschichold: The greatest benefit from looking at good work will always be gained by those who study its finest details and subtleties.

Hence, on this special day, the church is packed with locals, as well as pilgrims from all over Europe.<br>But when fire attacks the tower where the precious relic is housed, and Mara then discovers that one of the pilgrims is a disciple of Martin Luther and a hater of such sacred relics, a Spanish priest threatens the might of the Inquisition and a German traveller takes refuge in the church. However, the next morning, a naked body is found dead, spread-eagled in the shape of a cross, on top of one of the tombs on the hill behind the church. Was it one of the true pilgrims who killed him?

Why do we worry so much about what others think of us and often feel social life is a stressful performance? Why is mental illness three times as common in the USA as in Germany? Why is the American dream more of a reality in Denmark than the USA? What makes child well-being so much worse in some countries than others? As <i>The Inner Level </i>demonstrates, the answer to all these is inequality. <br><br> In&nbsp;<i>The Spirit Level</i>&nbsp;Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett put inequality at the center of public debate by showing conclusively that less equal societies fare worse than more equal ones across everything from education to life expectancy.&nbsp;<i>The Inner Level</i>&nbsp;now explains how inequality affects us individually, altering how we think, feel and behave. It sets out the overwhelming evidence that material inequities have powerful psychological effects: when the gap between rich and poor increases, so does the tendency to define and value ourselves and others in terms of superiority and inferiority. A deep well of data and analysis is drawn upon to empirically show, for example, that low social status leads to elevated levels of stress hormones, and how rates of anxiety, depression and addictions are intimately related to the inequality which makes that status paramount.<br><br> Wilkinson and Pickett describe how these responses to hierarchies evolved, and why the impacts of inequality on us are so severe. In doing so, they challenge the conception that humans are inescapably competitive and self-interested. They undermine, too, the idea that inequality is the product of "natural" differences in individual ability. This book draws together many of the most urgent problems facing societies today, but it is not just an index of our ills. It demonstrates that societies based on fundamental equalities, sharing and reciprocity generate much higher levels of well-being, and lays out the path towards them.</p><p><b>Richard Wilkinson</b> has played a formative role in international research on the social determinants of health.

Booklist heralded Ms. Frizzle as &#34;the wackiest, wisest teacher in picture books.&#34; Two MSB titles have been named School Library Journal Best Books of the Year, and they have won countless state book awards, from New York to Nebraska.Grade 1-4-- Time to board the Magic School Bus again with that wild, wacky, and wonderful teacher, Ms. Frizzle. After she teaches her class about the human body and they visit the science museum, Mrs. Frizzle shrinks the bus and the class--except Arnold, who swallows them. This gives Cole and Degen the chance for two parallel stories, inside and outside of Arnold. With the bus inside, Cole explains digestion from the stomach into the small intestines. Then the bus enters a blood vessel where readers can see the plasma, red and white blood cells, and the flow into the heart. From there the class, now out of the bus and garbed in operating room smocks and masks, flows with the blood cells, now with fresh oxygen, to the brain. They climb down the bones of the spine, follow nerves to see muscles work, and then finally catch up with the bus to emerge in the nasal cavity. Meanwhile on part of each facing page, Arnold has coped with being lost and alone and has made it back to the school. With an enormous sneeze he sends the bus out to join him in the parking lot. The class can now chart the body from actual experience. Cole concludes with a true-false test with answers to help readers distinguish reality from fantasy. As readers of the previous "Magic School Bus" books (Scholastic) know, this is an enjoyable look at factual material painlessly packaged with the ribbons and balloons of jokes and asides meant to appeal to kids. Degen's zany, busy, full-color drawings fill the pages with action and information far beyond the text. Using a variety of visuals, including notes, close-ups, and diagrams along with a variety of realistic kids, he moves the parallel stories to their conclusions. Kids will love this book. --Sylvia S.

Special Branch officer Thomas Pitt, hastening to rendezvous with him, arrives a second too late, preceded by a knife-wielding assassin. As the mortally wounded man&#x2019;s life slips away, so too does the information Pitt desperately needs. The killer in turn flees on an erratic course that leads Pitt in wild pursuit, from London&#x2019;s cobblestone streets to picturesque St. Malo on the French coast.<br> <br>Meanwhile, Pitt&#x2019;s supervisor, the formidable Victor Narraway, finds himself accused of embezzling government funds. With Pitt incommunicado in France, Narraway turns to Pitt&#x2019;s clever wife, Charlotte, for help. The man who badmouthed Narraway and ruined his career with innuendo can be found in Ireland&#x2014;so Charlotte agrees to pose as Narraway&#x2019;s sister and accompany him to Dublin to investigate.<br> &nbsp;<br> But unknown to Pitt and Narraway, a shadowy plotter is setting a trap that, once sprung, could destroy not just reputations but the British empire itself.</p><p><b>Anne Perry </b>is the bestselling author of two acclaimed series set in Victorian England: the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels, including <i>Buckingham Palace Gardens </i>and <i>Long Spoon Lane,</i> and the William Monk novels, including <i>Execution Dock</i> and <i>Dark Assassin.</i> She is also the author of the World War I novels <i>No Graves As Yet, Shoulder the Sky, Angels in the Gloom, At Some Disputed Barricade,</i> and <i>We Shall Not Sleep,</i> as well as seven holiday novels, most recently <i>A Christmas Odyssey,</i> and a historical novel, <i>The Sheen on the Silk,</i> set in the Ottoman Empire. Anne Perry lives in Scotland.C H A P T E R <br> <br> 1<br>&#x201c;Tha t&#x2019;s him!&#x201d; Gower yelled above the sound of the traffic. Pitt turned on his heel just in time to see a figure dart between the rear end of a hansom and the oncoming horses of a brewer&#x2019;s dray. Gower disappeared after him, missing a trampling by no more than inches. <br> <br>Pitt plunged into the street, swerving to avoid a brougham and stopping abruptly to let another hansom pass. By the time he reached the far pavement Gower was twenty yards ahead and Pitt could make out only his flying hair. The man he was pursuing was out of sight. Weaving between clerks in pinstripes, leisurely strollers, and the occasional early woman shopper with her long skirts getting in the way, Pitt closed the gap until he was less than a dozen yards behind Gower. He caught a glimpse of the man ahead: bright ginger hair and a green jacket. Then he was gone, and Gower turned, his right hand raised for a moment in signal, before disappearing into an alley. <br> <br>Pitt followed after him into the shadows, his eyes taking a moment or two to adjust. The alley was long and narrow, bending in a dogleg a hundred yards beyond. The gloom was caused by the overhanging eaves and the water-soaked darkness of the brick, long streams of grime running down from the broken guttering. People were huddled in doorways; others made their way slowly, limping, or staggering beneath heavy bolts of cloth, barrels, and bulging sacks. <br> <br>Gower was still ahead, seeming to find his way with ease. Pitt veered around a fat woman with a tray of matches to sell, and tried to catch up. Gower was at least ten years younger, even if his legs were not quite so long, and he was more used to this kind of thing. But it was Pitt&#x2019;s experience in the Metropolitan Police before he joined Special Branch that had led them to finding West, the man they were now chasing. <br> <br>Pitt bumped into an old woman and apologized before regaining his stride. They were around the dogleg now, and he could see West&#x2019;s ginger head making for the opening into the wide thoroughfare forty yards away. Pitt knew that they must catch him before he was swallowed up in the crowds. <br> <br>Gower was almost there. He reached out an arm to grab at West, but just then West ducked sideways and Gower tripped, hurtling into the wall and momentarily winding himself. He bent over double, gasping to catch his breath. <br> <br>Pitt lengthened his stride and reached West just as he dived out into the High Street, barged his way through a knot of people, and disappeared. <br> <br>Pitt went after him and a moment later saw the light on his bright hair almost at the next crossroads. He increased his pace, bumping and banging people. He had to catch him. West had information that could be vital. After all, the tide of unrest was rising fast all over Europe, and becoming more violent. Many people, in the name of re- form, were actually trying to overthrow government altogether and create an anarchy in which they imagined there would be some kind of equality of justice. Some were content with blood-soaked oratory; others preferred dynamite, or even bullets. <br> <br>Special Branch knew of a current plot, but not yet the leaders be- hind it, or&#x2014;more urgently&#x2014;the target of their violence. West was to provide that, at risk of his own life&#x2014;if his betrayal were known. <br> <br>Where the devil was Gower? Pitt swiveled around once to see if he could spot him. He was nowhere visible in the sea of bobbing heads, bowler hats, caps, and bonnets. There was no time to look longer. Surely he wasn&#x2019;t still in the alley? What was wrong with the man? He was not much more than thirty. Had he been more than just knocked off balance? Was he injured? <br> <br>West was up ahead, seizing a break in the traffic to cross back to the other side again. Three hansoms came past almost nose-to-tail. A cart and four clattered in the opposite direction. Pitt fumed on the edge of the curb. To go out into the roadway now would only get him killed. <br> <br>A horse-drawn omnibus passed, then two heavily loaded wagons. More carts and a dray went in the other direction. Pitt had lost sight of West, and Gower had vanished into the air. <br> <br>There was a brief holdup in traffic and Pitt raced across the road. Weaving in and out of the way of frustrated drivers, he only just missed being caught by a long, curling carriage whip. Someone yelled at him and he took no notice. He reached the opposite side and caught sight of West for an instant as he swung around a corner and made for another alley. <br> <br>Pitt raced after him, but when he got there West had disappeared. &#x201c;Did you see a man with ginger hair?&#x201d; Pitt demanded of a peddler <br> <br>with a tray of sandwiches. &#x201c;Where did he go?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Want a sandwich?&#x201d; the man asked with eyes wide. &#x201c;Very good. Made this morning. Only tuppence.&#x201d; <br> <br>Pitt fished frantically in his pocket; found string, sealing wax, a pocketknife, a handkerchief, and several coins. He gave the man a threepenny bit and took a sandwich. It felt soft and fresh, although right now he didn&#x2019;t care. &#x201c;Which way?&#x201d; he said harshly. <br> <br>&#x201c;That way.&#x201d; The man pointed into the deeper shadows of the alley. <br> <br>Pitt began to run again, weaving a path through the piles of rubbish. A rat skittered from under his feet, and he all but fell over a drunken figure lying half out of a doorway. Somebody swung a punch at him; he lurched to one side, losing his balance for a moment, glimpsing West still ahead of him. Now West disappeared again and Pitt had no idea which way he had gone. He tried one blind courtyard and alley after another. It seemed like endless, wasted moments before Gower joined him from one of the side alleyways. <br> <br>&#x201c;Pitt!&#x201d; Gower clutched at his arm. &#x201c;This way! Quickly.&#x201d; His fingers dug deep into Pitt&#x2019;s flesh, making him gasp with the sudden pain. <br> <br>Together they ran forward, Pitt along the broken pavement be- side the dark walls, Gower in the gutter, his boots sending up a spray of filthy water. Pace for pace, they went around the corner into the open entrance to a brickyard and saw a man crouching over some- thing on the ground. <br> <br>Gower let out a cry of fury and darted forward, half crossing in front of Pitt and tripping him up in his eagerness. They both fell heavily. Pitt was on his feet in time to see the crouched figure swing around for an instant, then scramble up and run as if for his life. <br> <br>&#x201c;Oh God!&#x201d; Gower said, aghast, now also on his feet. &#x201c;After him! I know who it is!&#x201d; <br> <br>Pitt stared at the heap on the ground: West&#x2019;s green jacket and bright hair. Blood streamed from his throat, staining his chest and al- ready pooling dark on the stones underneath him. There was no way he could possibly be alive. <br> <br>Gower was already pursuing the assassin. Pitt raced after him and this time his long strides caught up before they reached the road. &#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d; he demanded, almost choking on his own breath. <br> <br>&#x201c;Wrexham!&#x201d; Gower hissed back. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been watching him for weeks.&#x201d; <br> <br>Pitt knew the man, but only by name. There was a momentary break in the stream of vehicles. They darted across the road to go after Wrexham, who thank heaven was an easy figure to see. He was taller than average, and&#x2014;despite the good weather&#x2014;he was wearing a long, pale-colored scarf that swung in the air as he twisted and turned. It flashed through Pitt&#x2019;s mind that it might be a weapon; it would not be hard to strangle a man with it. <br> <br>They were on a crowded footpath now, and Wrexham dropped his pace. He almost sauntered, walking easily, swiftly, with loping strides, but perfectly casual. Could he be arrogant enough to imagine he had lost them so quickly? He certainly knew they had seen him, because he had swiveled around at Gower&#x2019;s cry, and then run as if for his life. <br> <br>They were now walking at a steady pace, eastward toward Stepney and Limehouse. Soon the crowds would thin as they left the broader streets behind. <br> <br>&#x201c;If he goes into an alley, be careful,&#x201d; Pitt warned, now beside Gower, as if they were two tradesmen bound on a common errand. &#x201c;He has a knife. He&#x2019;s too comfortable. He must know we&#x2019;re behind him.&#x201d; <br> <br>Gower glanced at him sideways, his eyes wide for an instant. &#x201c;You think he&#x2019;ll try and pick us off?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;We practically saw him cut West&#x2019;s throat,&#x201d; Pitt replied, matching Gower stride for stride. &#x201c;If we get him he&#x2019;ll hang. He must know that.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;I reckon he&#x2019;ll duck and hide suddenly, when he thinks we&#x2019;re taking it easy,&#x201d; Gower answered. &#x201c;We&#x2019;d better stay fairly close to him. Lose sight of him for a moment and he&#x2019;ll be gone for good.&#x201d; <br> <br>Pitt agreed with a nod, and they closed the distance to Wrexham, who was still strolling ahead of them. Never once did he turn or look back. <br> <br>Pitt found it chilling that a man could slit another&#x2019;s throat and see him bleed to death, then a few moments after walk through a crowd with outward unconcern, as if he were just one more pedestrian about some trivial daily business. What passion or inhumanity drove him? In the way he moved, the fluidity&#x2014;almost grace&#x2014;of his stride, Pitt could not detect even fear, let alone the conscience of a brutal murderer. <br> <br>Wrexham wove in and out of the thinning crowd. Twice they lost sight of him. <br> <br>&#x201c;That way!&#x201d; Gower gasped, waving his right hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go left.&#x201d; He swerved arou...</p><h2>Upholstery: A Complete Course : Chairs, Sofas, Ottomans, Screens and Stools</h2><p>"This massive compilation of facts, skills, techniques, designs and insider advice tells you everything....Set up your own workshop with just a few tools, a staple gun, cloth and foam cutters....It's practically enough information to make you a professional upholsterer!"-- "Decorating Country Style<p>. 296 pages (8 in color), 474 b/w illus., 8 1/4 x 11 3/4.</p></p><p>This revised and expanded edition of this classic text has now been produced in full colour throughout.

She teaches at the University of Chicago and lives in Chicago.</p>*Starred Review* Besides the ancient Greeks, classicist William Arrowsmith (1924&#x2013;92) loved modern Italian literature. He translated all the poetry of the archetypal Italian modernist Montale (1896&#x2013;1981) that emerged before his own death. Arrowsmith also critically annotated his translations, revealing not only Montale&#x2019;s poetical inspirations and philosophical aims but also the cogent opinions of the best Montale critics. This volume corrals all the translations and much of the notes and, with editor Warren&#x2019;s startlingly economical (because so informative) introduction and the Italian texts of the poems across the gutter from the translations, opens Montale to Anglophone readers definitively. Montale has a reputation for difficulty, but Arrowsmith&#x2019;s renderings are remarkably accessible and, for those who can sufficiently glom the Italian, seem utterly faithful. They can be pleasurably read without Warren&#x2019;s and Arrowsmith&#x2019;s elucidations (though even more pleasurably with them), for they manifest the sharp imagery, the simplicity of diction (Montale regretted the polysyllabicalism of basic Italian; no such problem with English), and the progressive clarification of voice, consciously approaching that of plain prose, that typify the unfolding poetic practice of, say, W. C. Williams among great American modernists. And Montale lived and wrote in a far more beautiful landscape (often the Italian Riviera), though sometimes amid much greater troubles (Mussolini&#x2019;s fascism). --Ray Olson</p><h2>Black Medicine: The Dark Art of Death</h2><p>A thorough analysis of the human body&#39;s vital points and how to use them to your advantage in combat handgunning and all types of hand-to-hand combat situations.

Ile-Rien, ruled in name by weak young King Roland but in fact by the Dowager Queen Ravenna, becomes the staging area for the sorcerer Urbain Grandier's vengeance against his native land, where he had been the victim of an inquisition mounted against magic. Thomas Boniface, captain of the Queen's Guard and Ravenna's former lover, aids the dowager in her fight to maintain stability and counter the pernicious influence of powerful nobles. The political balance is further upset when the court sorcerer dies, weakening the palace's defenses against Fayre and allowing Kade Carrion, the king's illegitimate half-sister, whose mother was the Fayre Queen of Air and Darkness, to return to court after many years of banishment. Skillfully blending the fantastical and the mundane, Wells delights with deft and sympathetic characterization while demonstrating a fine touch for adventure. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Best American Poetry 2018 (The Best American Poetry series)</h2><p><b>The 2018 edition of the <i>Best American Poetry</i>&#x2014;&#x201c;a &#x2018;best&#x2019; anthology that really lives up to its title&#x201d; (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>)&#x2014;collects the most significant poems of the year, chosen by Poet Laureate of California Dana Gioia.</b><br><br>The guest editor for 2018, Dana Gioia, has an unconventional poetic background.

The First World War is over, the battle is lost a and everywhere there is talk of revolution. Leaders of the German military have formed an uneasy alliance with the socialists who control the government and have proclaimed a new German republic, but throughout Berlin rival groups stage rallies and organize strikes. In A People Betrayed, the first volume of the epic November 1918: A German Revolution, Alfred Doblin takes us into the public and private dramas of these turbulent days, introducing us to a remarkable cast of fictional and historical characters, and bringing them to life in one of the great historical epics of the century.</p><p>Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Julia Child &amp; Company</h2><p>Features recipes that will be shown on Child&#39;s new series in addition to presenting dishes and alternate selections for thirteen meals she has matched up with different types of guests</p><p></p><h2>Lullabies: An Illustrated Songbook</h2><p>Words and music for thirty-seven of the most beloved traditional lullabies are gathered in this lavishly illustrated songbook.

As was true in Go In and Out the Window (Holt, 1987) and Songs of the Wild West (S &amp; S, 1991), the art gives each of the songs its own personality and underlines both its message and its feeling. "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot," "Toora Loora Loora," and "Rock-a-Bye, Baby" are among the selections included. Scenes of mother and baby are everywhere. Works from artists such as American Maurice Prendergast, accompanying the song "Baby's Bed's a Silver Moon," and French artist Maurice Boutet de Monvel illustrating the lullaby "Fais Dodo" wrap this book in an aura of love and gentleness. The photographs are particularly effective. Alma Lavenson's "Hand Studies?Child with Doll" illustrates "Rock-a-Bye, Baby," conjuring up images of children everywhere rocking their "babies." Eliot Porter's "Jonathan," showing a blissfully sleeping baby, thumb in mouth, is perfectly paired with "All Through the Night." This is a lovely book for parents, grandparents, and lovers of babies everywhere. The songs have arrangements that capture both the mood and the sense of the selection. Unfortunately, many of them are arranged so that at least one page must be turned to play the whole song.

There, she witnesses a group of gifted healers led by the charismatic Nicholas Darrow. Gaining refuge at last, Alice is drawn--inexorably, seductively--into the complex network of relationships at St. Benet's healing center--as she falls immediately, dangerously, in love with Darrow himself. <br><br>Yet Darrow and his cutting-edge clergy are not all what they seem. And while Nicholas's dazzling powers now threaten to ruin all he attempts to save--including his own disturbed marriage--Alice's devotion to him deepens. Then a&nbsp;&nbsp;devastating tragedy transports her to the shocking center of truth. Yet fueled by her love for Nicholas and a boldly emerging intuition, she will hold together the lives spinning wildly out of control--as she herself is transformed forever.</p><p>Three years before <i>The Wonder Worker</i> was released, in the afterword of the sixth installment in her Starbridge set of ecclesiastical novels, Susan Howatch dashed her fans' dreams. <i>Absolute Truths</i> was to be her last intellectual surplice-ripper. Did this mean we would be left forever wondering whether megacharismatic Nicholas Darrow would find a way to meld his psychic talents and his religious calling? What about his sidekick and mentor, Lewis Hall--would he ever manage to control his substantial earthly appetites? And what of gifted substance-abuser Venetia Hoffenberg? Would she be forever denied the literary chance to just say no? Luckily for us, all three are back in Howatch's latest, serious sacerdotal romp. But <i>The Wonder Worker</i> plays out nowhere near Starbridge's great cathedral and is not even indirectly about Anglican power struggles or traditions. It is set instead in St. Benet's-by-the-Wall, a small church and healing center in London's inner city. The book does, however, feature all of the author's strengths: vivid characterization, scenes of flamboyant and unorthodox religious power, and emotionally exhilarating personal encounters. Nicholas Darrow is back, not as chief narrator, but seen through three sets of eyes: those of Alice, a young woman who seems to see him more clearly than anyone save his mentor; Lewis; and his disillusioned wife, Rosalind. Nicholas's own viewpoint reveals his life and job as healer extraordinaire swinging out of control. In addition to the pleasures of the multiple viewpoints, there are the usual (i.e. unusual) pleasures of watching Howatch make the spiritual flesh. Though she has often been compared to Anthony Trollope, one astute reviewer has termed her "the love child of Graham Greene and Iris Murdoch." Other writers might approach her talent, but few would dare follow up a scene in which Nicholas hypnotizes his wife into sex with an even more exciting one in which he is called to order by his spiritual adviser, a nun!<b>Susan Howatch</b> was born in Surrey. After getting a degree in law, she emigrated to America, where she married, had a daughter, and embarked on a career as a writer. When she eventually left the United States, she lived in the Republic of Ireland for four years before returning to England. She spent time in Salisbury&#x2014;which was the inspiration for her Starbridge sequence of novels&#x2014;and now lives in London.</p><h2>The Romagnolis&#39; Table: Italian Family Recipes</h2><p>Amusing anecdotes about culinary traditions in Italy are presented together with more than two hundred recipes for appetizers, first and second courses, vegetables, desserts, and snacks</p><p></p><h2>Clockwork</h2><p>Borrowing elements of Frankenstein, Pinocchio, and Faust, the popular author of The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife creates a suspenseful fantasy tale about an apprentice clockmaker who sells his soul.</p><p>While Philip Pullman's greatest popularity is as a creator of novel-length magical realism for young adults, such as <i><i>The Golden Compass</i></i>, he continues to explore and stretch the limits of other children's and young adult genres. <i>Clockwork</i> is no exception. With its inspiration lying solidly in the German romantic tradition of E.T.A. Hoffmann and the Brothers Grimm, the story begins, as all good fairy tales do, with someone whose human weakness sets events inescapably in motion. As the townspeople of Glockenheim gather in the White Horse Tavern on the eve of the unveiling of a new figure for their great town clock, Karl, the clockmaker's apprentice, reveals to Fritz, a young storyteller, that he has not been able to construct the figure. A new clock figure is expected of all apprentices, and Karl is the first in hundreds of years to fail. Fritz, in his turn, has the beginnings of a new story to tell, and as it rolls off his tongue, its dark antagonist materializes and offers Karl his dearest wish. Not surprisingly, Karl's Faustian pact brings him destruction, but an innocent child is the deus ex machina that saves another child and the spirit of the town from seemingly ineluctable oblivion. With its eerie black-and-white illustrations by Leonid Gore and its happily-ever-after ending to some thrilling suspense, <i>Clockwork</i> is a fine fairy tale for younger children and a thought-provoking twist on the art of narrative for older ones. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i>An apprentice clockmaker. A sinister doctor. An inn-keeper&#39;s daughter. A prince who is not-quite human, and a statue who is not quite...not. All of these characters are brought together in a masterpiece of suspense that keeps the heart thumping to the very last page, and the mind whirring long afterward.</p><h2>Old Testament Theology: Volume I: The Theology of Israel&#39;s Historical Traditions</h2><p><p>This republication of a classic work contains a new introduction by Walter Brueggemann that places Gerhard von Rad's work within the context of German theology, Old Testament theology, and the history of interpretation of the Old Testament.

Selma, Alabama.</p> <p>About eight thousand people gather at Brown Chapel and begin to march from the town of Selma to the city of Montgomery, Alabama. The demonstrators are predominantly African American and they&#x2019;re marching on the capitol for one reason: <i>Justice.</i> They want simply to be given the right to vote. But they&#x2019;re not alone in their struggle. Demonstrators of "every race, religion, and class," representing almost every state, have come to march with their black brothers and sisters.1 And at the front of the march is the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Nobel Prize winner, preacher, and civil rights activist, leading the march like Moses leading his people out of Egypt.</p> <p>In the teeth of racial opposition backed by armed police and riot squads, they had tried to march twice before, but both times were met with violence by state troopers and a deputized posse. The first time&#x2014;known as Bloody Sunday&#x2014;the marchers were ordered to turn back but refused and, as onlookers cheered, they were met with tear gas, billy clubs, and rubber tubing wrapped in barbed wire. The second time they were again met by a line of state troopers and ordered to turn around, and after asking for permission to pray, King led them back.</p> <p>But not this time. This time President Lyndon B. Johnson, finally having seen the writing on the wall, ordered that the marchers should be protected by two thousand National Guard troops and federal marshals. And so they marched. For five days, over a span of fifty-three miles, through biting cold and frequent rain, they marched. Word spread, the number of demonstrators grew, and by the time they reached the steps of the capitol in Montgomery on March 25, their numbers had swelled to at least twenty-five thousand.</p> <p>But King wasn&#x2019;t allowed on the steps of the capitol&#x2014;the marchers weren&#x2019;t allowed on state property. Sitting in the capitol dome like Pontius Pilate, Alabama governor George Wallace refused to come out and address the marchers, and Dr. King delivered his speech from a platform constructed on a flatbed truck parked on the street in front of the building.2 And from that platform, King delivered his stirring anthem to freedom, first recalling how they had marched through "desolate valleys," rested on "rocky byways," were scorched by the sun, slept in mud, and were drenched by rains. The crowd, consisting of freedom-seeking people who had assembled from around the United States, listened intently as Dr. King implored them to remain committed to the nonviolent philosophy of civil disobedience, knowing that the patience of oppressed peoples wears thin and that our natural inclination is to hit back when struck. He asked, rhetorically, "How long will prejudice blind the visions of men, darken their understanding, and drive bright-eyed wisdom from her sacred throne?" And "How long will justice be crucified and truth bear it?" In response, Dr. King offered words of counsel, comfort, and assurance, saying that no matter the obstacles it wouldn&#x2019;t be long before freedom was realized because, he said, quoting religious and biblical tropes, "truth crushed to earth will rise again," "no lie can live forever," "you shall reap what you sow," and "the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."3</p> <p>It was one of the greatest speeches of Dr. King&#x2019;s career, and arguably one of the greatest in the history of public oratory. And it worked. Less than five months later, on August 6, 1965, President Johnson signed the voting rights act into law. It was just as Dr. King had said&#x2014;the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice.</p>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022; <p></p> <p>Dr. King&#x2019;s reference&#x2014;the title inspiration for this book&#x2014;comes from the nineteenth-century abolitionist preacher Theodore Parker, who penned this piece of moral optimism in 1853, at a time when, if anything, pessimism would have been more appropriate as America was inexorably sliding toward civil war over the very institution Parker sought to abolish:</p> <p>I do not pretend to understand the moral universe; the arc is a long one, my eye reaches but little ways; I cannot calculate the curve and complete the figure by the experience of sight; I can divine it by conscience. And from what I see I am sure it bends towards justice.4</p> <p>In <i>The Moral Arc</i> my aim is to show that the Reverends Parker and King were right&#x2014;that the arc of the moral universe does indeed bend toward justice. In addition to religious conscience and stirring rhetoric, however, we can trace the moral arc through science with data from many different lines of inquiry, all of which demonstrate that in general, as a species, we are becoming increasingly moral. As well, I argue that most of the moral development of the past several centuries has been the result of secular not religious forces, and that the most important of these that emerged from the Age of Reason and the Enlightenment are science and reason, terms that I use in the broadest sense to mean reasoning through a series of arguments and then confirming that the conclusions are true through empirical verification.</p> <p>Further, I demonstrate that the arc of the moral universe bends not merely toward justice, but also toward truth and freedom, and that these positive outcomes have largely been the product of societies moving toward more secular forms of governance and politics, law and jurisprudence, moral reasoning and ethical analysis. Over time it has become less acceptable to argue that my beliefs, morals, and ways of life are better than yours simply because they are mine, or because they are traditional, or because my religion is better than your religion, or because my God is the One True God and yours is not, or because my nation can pound the crap out of your nation. It is no longer acceptable to simply <i>assert</i> your moral beliefs; you have to provide <i>reasons</i> for them, and those reasons had better be grounded in rational arguments and empirical evidence or else they will likely be ignored or rejected.</p> <p>Historically, we can look back and see that we have been steadily&#x2014;albeit at times haltingly&#x2014;expanding the moral sphere to include more members of our species (and now even other species) as legitimate participants in the moral community. The burgeoning conscience of humanity has grown to the point where we no longer consider the well-being only of our family, extended family, and local community; rather, our consideration now extends to people quite unlike ourselves, with whom we gladly trade goods and ideas and exchange sentiments and genes rather than beating, enslaving, raping, or killing them (as our sorry species was wont to do with reckless abandon not so long ago). Nailing down the cause-and-effect relationship between human action and moral progress&#x2014;that is, determining <i>why</i> it has happened&#x2014;is the other primary theme of this book, with the implied application of what we can do to adjust the variables in the equation to continue expanding the moral sphere and push our civilization further along the moral arc.</p> <p>Improvements in the domain of morality are evident in many areas of life: <i>governance</i> (the rise of liberal democracies and the decline of theocracies and autocracies); <i>economics</i> (broader property rights and the freedom to trade goods and services with others without oppressive restrictions); <i>rights</i> (to life, liberty, property, marriage, reproduction, voting, speech, worship, assembly, protest, autonomy, and the pursuit of happiness); <i>prosperity</i> (the explosion of wealth and increasing affluence for more people in more places; and the decline of poverty worldwide in which a smaller percentage of the world&#x2019;s people are impoverished than at any time in history); <i>health and longevity</i> (more people in more places more of the time live longer, healthier lives than at any time in the past); <i>war</i> (a smaller percentage of people die as a result of violent conflict today than at any time since our species began); <i>slavery</i> (outlawed everywhere in the world and practiced in only a few places in the form of sexual slavery and slave labor that are now being targeted for total abolition); <i>homicide</i> (rates have fallen precipitously from over 100 murders per 100,000 people in the Middle Ages to less than one per 100,000 today in the industrial West, and the chances of an individual dying violently is the lowest it has ever been in history); <i>rape and sexual assault</i> (trending downward, and while still too prevalent, it is outlawed by all Western states and increasingly prosecuted); <i>judicial restraint</i> (torture and the death penalty have been almost universally outlawed by states, and where it is still legal is less frequently practiced); <i>judicial equality</i> (citizens of nations are treated more equally under the law than at any time in the past); and <i>civility</i> (people are kinder, more civilized, and less violent to one another than ever before).</p> <p>In short, we are living in the most moral period in our species&#x2019; history.</p> <p>I do not go so far as to argue that these favorable developments are inevitable or the result of an inexorable unfolding of a moral law of the universe&#x2014;this is not an "end of history" argument&#x2014;but there are identifiable causal relationships among social, political, and economic factors and moral outcomes. As Steven Pinker wrote in <i>The Better Angels of Our Nature</i>, a work of breathtaking erudition that was one of the inspirations for this book:</p> <p>Man&#x2019;s inhumanity to man has long been a subject for moralization. With the knowledge that something has driven it down we can also treat it as a matter of cause and effect. Instead of asking "Why is there war?" we might ask "Why is there peace?" We can obsess not just over what we have been doing wrong but also what we have been doing right. Because we have been doing something right and it would be good to know what exactly it is.5</p> <p>For tens of millennia moral <i>regress</i> best described our species, and hundreds of millions of people suffered as a result. But then something happened half a millennium ago. The Scientific Revolution led to the Age of Reason and the Enlightenment, and that changed everything. As a result, we ought to understand what happened, how and why these changes reversed our species&#x2019; historical trend downward, and that we can do more to elevate humanity, extend the arc, and bend it ever upward.</p>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022; <p></p> <p>During the years I spent researching and writing this book, when I told people that the subject was moral progress, to describe the responses I received as incredulous would be an understatement; most people thought I was hallucinatory. A quick rundown of the week&#x2019;s bad news would seem to confirm the diagnosis.</p> <p>The reaction is understandable because our brains evolved to notice and remember immediate and emotionally salient events, short-term trends, and personal anecdotes. And our sense of time ranges from the psychological "now" of three seconds to the few decades of a human lifetime, which is far too short to track long-term incremental trends unfolding over centuries and millennia, such as evolution, climate change, and&#x2014;to my thesis&#x2014;moral progress. If you only ever watched the evening news you would soon have ample evidence that the antithesis of my thesis is true&#x2014;that things are bad and getting worse. But news agencies are tasked with reporting only the bad news&#x2014;the ten thousand acts of kindness that happen every day go unreported. But one act of violence&#x2014;a mass public shooting, a violent murder, a terrorist suicide bombing&#x2014;is covered in excruciating detail with reporters on the scene, exclusive interviews with eyewitnesses, long shots of ambulances and police squad cars, and the thwap-thwap-thwap of news choppers overhead providing an aerial perspective on the mayhem. Rarely do news anchors remind their viewers that school shootings are still incredibly rare, that crime rates are hovering around an all-time low, and that acts of terror almost always fail to achieve their objective and their victim death tolls are negligible compared to other forms of death.</p> <p>News agencies also report what <i>happens</i>, not what <i>doesn&#x2019;t</i> happen. We will never see a headline that reads,</p> <p>ANOTHER YEAR WITHOUT NUCLEAR WAR</p> <p>This too is a sign of moral progress in that such negative news is still so uncommon that it is worth reporting. Were school shootings, murders, and terrorist attacks as commonplace as charity events, peacekeeping missions, and disease cures, our species would not be long for this world.</p> <p>As well, not everyone shares my sanguine view of science and reason, which has found itself in recent decades under attack on many fronts: right-wing ideologues who do not understand science; religious-right conservatives who fear science; left-wing postmodernists who do not trust science when it doesn&#x2019;t support progressive tenets about human nature; extreme environmentalists who want to return to a prescientific and preindustrial agrarian society; antivaxxers who wrongly imagine that vaccinations cause autism and other maladies; anti-GMO (genetically modified food) activists who worry about Frankenfoods; and educators of all stripes who cannot articulate why Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) are so vital to a modern democratic nation.</p> <p>Evidence-based reasoning is the hallmark of science today. It embodies the principles of objective data, theoretical explanation, experimental methodology, peer review, public transparency and open criticism, and trial and error as the most reliable means of determining who is right&#x2014;not only about the natural world, but about the social and moral worlds as well. In this sense many apparently immoral beliefs are actually factual errors based on incorrect causal theories. Today we hold that it is immoral to burn women as witches, but the reason our European ancestors in the Middle Ages strapped women on a pyre and torched them was because they believed that witches caused crop failures, weather anomalies, diseases, and various other maladies and misfortunes. Now that we have a scientific understanding of agriculture, climate, disease, and other causal vectors&#x2014;including the role of chance&#x2014;the witch theory of causality has fallen into disuse; what was a seemingly moral matter was actually a factual mistake.</p> <p>This conflation of facts and values explains a lot about our history, in which it was once (erroneously) believed that gods need animal and human sacrifices, that demons possess people and cause them to act crazy, that Jews cause plagues and poison wells, that African blacks are better off as slaves, that some races are inferior or superior to other races, that women want to be controlled or dominated by men, that animals are automata and feel no pain, that kings rule by divine right, and other beliefs no rational, scientifically literate person today would hold, much less proffer as a viable idea to be taken seriously. The Enlightenment philosopher Voltaire explicated the problem succinctly: "Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities." 6</p> <p>One path (among many) to a more moral world is to get people to quit believing in absurdities. Science and reason are the best methods for doing that. As a methodology, science has no parallel; it is the ultimate means by which we can understand how the world works, including the moral world. Thus, employing science to determine the conditions that best expand the moral sphere is itself a moral act. The experimental methods and analytical reasoning of science&#x2014;w...</p></p><h2>Angels in My Hair: The True Story of a Modern-Day Irish Mystic</h2><p><p>For anyone who has ever wondered about the mysteries that lie beyond everyday experience, or doubted the reality of the afterlife, <i>Angels in My Hair </i> is a moving and deeply inspirational journey into the unseen world.<br><br>For as long as she can remember, Lorna Byrne has seen angels.

Lorna is trusted for her ability to communicate with spirits and angels&#x2014;and by sharing her intimate knowledge of the spiritual world she offers a message of hope and love to us all. <br><br><i>Angels in My Hair </i>is an engrossing chronicle of Lorna&#x2019;s incredible life story. Invoking a wonderful sense of place, she describes growing up poor in Ireland, finding work in Dublin, and marrying the man of her dreams&#x2014;only to have the marriage cut short by tragedy. Already a bestseller in Ireland, her story gives readers a unique insight into the angelic help that is around us and available to us all the time. As Lorna says, "All you have to do is ask."<br><br>In this uplifting autobiography, a modern-day Irish mystic shares her vivid encounters and conversations with the angels and spirits she has known her entire life.</p></p><p>Angels In My Hair is the autobiography of a modern day mystic, an Irish woman with powers of the saints of old. <p>When she was a child, people thought Lorna was retarded because she did not seem to be focussing on the world around her. Lorna remembers seeing not just the world around her but seeing equally vividly angels and spirits. For many years she assumed everyone saw the same. </p> <p>As Lorna tells the story of her life, growing up in a poor family, later working in Dublin, marrying and experiencing family tragedy, the reader meets, as she did, the creatures from the spirit worlds who also inhabit our own - mostly angels of an astonishing beauty and variety � including the prophet Elijah and an Archangel- but also the spirits of people who have died. </p> <p>Today, it is not only the sick and troubled who come to visit Lorna, looking for healing and consolation, but theologians of different faiths and the head of a religious order in Rome are asking her for guidance too. </p> <p>This remarkable document is the testimony of a woman who sees things at the far end of the spectrum, beyond the range of our everyday experience.</p><p>Lorna Byrne has been seeing and talking to angels since she was a baby. Now, having raised her family, she talks openly for the first time about what she has seen and learned. She lives quietly in rural Ireland.</p></p><h2>The Amber Spyglass (His Dark Materials S.)</h2><p>The final instalment in the &#34;Dark Materials&#34; trilogy. For all those who are dying to learn the fate of Will and Lyra, hoping for the return of Iorek Byrnison, longing to know the truth about Dust, and waiting to face the ultimate clash of opposing powers, this book has the answers.</p><p>From the very start of its very first scene, <i>The Amber Spyglass</i> will set hearts fluttering and minds racing. All we'll say here is that we immediately discover who captured Lyra at the end of <i>The Subtle Knife</i>, though we've yet to discern whether this individual's intent is good, evil, or somewhere in between. We also learn that Will still possesses the blade that allows him to cut between worlds, and has been joined by two winged companions who are determined to escort him to Lord Asriel's mountain redoubt. The boy, however, has only one goal in mind--to rescue his friend and return to her the alethiometer, an instrument that has revealed so much to her and to readers of <i>The Golden Compass</i> and its follow-up. Within a short time, too, we get to experience the "tingle of the starlight" on Serafina Pekkala's skin as she seeks out a famished Iorek Byrnison and enlists him in Lord Asriel's crusade: <blockquote> A complex web of thoughts was weaving itself in the bear king's mind, with more strands in it than hunger and satisfaction. There was the memory of the little girl Lyra, whom he had named Silvertongue, and whom he had last seen crossing the fragile snow bridge across a crevasse in his own island of Svalbard. Then there was the agitation among the witches, the rumors of pacts and alliances and war; and then there was the surpassingly strange fact of this new world itself, and the witch's insistence that there were many more such worlds, and that the fate of them all hung somehow on the fate of the child. </blockquote> Meanwhile, two factions of the Church are vying to reach Lyra first. One is even prepared to give a priest "preemptive absolution" should he succeed in committing mortal sin. For these tyrants, killing this girl is no less than "a sacred task." <p> In the final installment of his trilogy, Philip Pullman has set himself the highest hurdles. He must match its predecessors in terms of sheer action and originality <i>and</i> resolve the enigmas he already created. The good news is that there is no critical bad news--not that <i>The Amber Spyglass</i> doesn't contain standoffs and close calls galore. (Who would have it otherwise?) But Pullman brings his audacious revision of <i>Paradise Lost</i> to a conclusion that is both serene and devastating. In prose that is transparent yet lyrical and 3-D, the author weaves in and out of his principals' thoughts. He also offers up several additional worlds. In one, Dr. Mary Malone is welcomed into an apparently simple society. The environment of the <i>mulefa</i> (again, we'll reveal nothing more) makes them rich in consciousness while their lives possess a slow and stately rhythm. These strange creatures can, however, be very fast on their feet (or on other things entirely) when necessary. Alas, they are on the verge of dying as Dust streams out of their idyllic landscape. Will the Oxford dark-matter researcher see her way to saving them, or does this require our young heroes? And while Mary is puzzling out a cure, Will and Lyra undertake a pilgrimage to a realm devoid of all light and hope, after having been forced into the cruelest of sacrifices--or betrayals. </p><p> Throughout his galvanizing epic, Pullman sustains scenes of fierce beauty and tenderness. He also allows us a moment or two of comic respite. At one point, for instance, Lyra's mother bullies a series of ecclesiastical underlings: "The man bowed helplessly and led her away. The guard behind her blew out his cheeks with relief." Needless to say, Mrs. Coulter is as intoxicating and fluid as ever. And can it be that we will come to admire her as she plays out her desperate endgame? In this respect, as in many others, <i>The Amber Spyglass</i> is truly a book of revelations, moving from darkness visible to radiant truth. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>"The Amber Spyglass brings the intrigue of "The Golden Compass and "The Subtle Knife to a heart-stopping end, marking the final volume of His Dark Materials as the most powerful of the trilogy. <br>Along with the return of Lyra, Will, Mrs. Coulter, Lord Asriel, Dr. Mary Malone, and Iorek Byrnison the armored bear, come a host of new characters: the Mulefa, mysterious wheeled creatures with the power to see Dust; Gallivespian Lord Roke, a hand-high spymaster to Lord Asriel; and Metatron, a fierce and mighty angel. So, too, come startling revelations: the painful price Lyra must pay to walk through the land of the dead, the haunting power of Dr. Malone's amber spyglass, and the names of who will live--and who will die--for love. And all the while, war rages with the Kingdom of Heaven, a brutal battle that--in its shocking outcome--will uncover the secret of Dust. Philip Pullman deftly brings the cliff-hangers and mysteries of His Dark Materials to an earthshattering conclusion--and confirms his fantasy trilogy as an undoubted and enduring classic.</p><h2>The Butterfly Hours: Transforming Memories into Memoir</h2><p><b>Discover the power and pleasure of writing from your life.&nbsp; We all have stories to tell, and Patty Dann can help you bring them forth. </b><br><br>Sometimes all it takes is a single word to spark a strong memory.

Eliot. The author sets out to discover just how his poetry, charged with coldness, antisemitism, misogyny, elitism and prissiness invites or incites prejudice.</p><p>Christopher Ricks is Co-Director, with Archie Burnett, of the Editorial Institute at Boston University. His publications on Eliot include T. S. Eliot and Prejudice (1988), Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909-1917 (1996), and Decisions and Revisions in T. S. Eliot (the Panizzi Lectures, 2002), together with True Friendship: Geoffrey Hill, Anthony Hecht and Robert Lowell Under the Sign of Eliot and Pound (2007). The Poems of T. S. Eliot (2 vols., 2015) is edited by Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue.Ricks has written not merely a fine study of T.S. Eliot but an interesting work of criticism that combines the best of New Criticism (a strict reading of texts and keen awareness of ambiguity) and of Deconstruction (a sensitivity to the way the text undercuts itself and deliberately frustrates simplistic "reader responses"). Ricks does an admirable job of explicating Eliot's "Prufrock," and in all his readings he gives fresh evidence of the highly complicated mind Eliot brought to bear on even the titles of his work. This is not another tired discussion of Eliot's racial prejudices (which Ricks nicely contrasts with those of Pound) but a profound inquiry into the nature of writing about prejudice, a kind of minefield where "even the demolition squad sows its own bombs."

The text of this edition comes from the Clarendon <em>Middlemarch</em>, the first critical edition of the novel.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.One of the most accomplished and prominent novels of the Victorian era, <i>Middlemarch</i> is an unsurpassed portrait of nineteenth-century English provincial life. Dorothea Brooke is a young woman of fervent ideals who yearns to effect social change yet faces resistance from the society she inhabits. In this epic in a small landscape, Eliot's large cast of precisely delineated characters and the rich tapestry of their stories result in a wise, compassionate, and astute vision of human nature. As Virginia Woolf declared, George Eliot "was one of the first English novelists to discover that men and women think as well as feel, and the discovery was of great artistic moment."<p><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p></p><h2>Modern Book Collecting</h2><p>Bound in the publisher&#39;s original gilt decorated quarter cloth and green boards.

Few figures have had such an influ�ence on history as Jesus of Nazareth. His teachings have inspired discussion, arguments, even war, and yet few have ever held forth as movingly on the need for peace, forgiveness, and mercy. Paul Johnson's brilliant reading offers readers a lively biography of the man who inspired one of the world's great religions and whose les�sons still guide us in current times.<br><br> Johnson's magisterial and revered book <i>A History of Christianity</i> is a masterpiece of historical writing on religion; and in his new book he returns to focus on a central figure in one of the world's dominant religions. Johnson's intelligent and conver�sational style, as well as his ability to distill complex subjects into succinct, highly readable works, make this book the ideal match of a major historian with a major subject. The result is an accessible biography and an insightful analysis of how Jesus is important in the present era.<br></p><p>Paul Johnson&#x2019;s many books, including <i>A History of Christianity, A History of the Jews, Modern Times, Churchill</i>, and <i>Napoleon: A Penguin Life</i>, have been hailed as masterpieces of historical analysis. He is a regular columnist for <i>Forbes</i> and <i>The Spectator</i>, and his work has also appeared in <i>The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal</i>, and many others publications. He lives in London.Journalist-historian Johnson&#x2019;s deliberately noncontentious account of history&#x2019;s most famous man is unapologetically, uncarpingly based on the New Testament. Nearly no other sources are mentioned, and the short further reading list admits nothing by any Jesus Seminar scholar or other revisionist. Since the book is longer than all four Gospels put together, it is obviously more than a conflationary synopsis. Johnson weighs what little is said about Jesus&#x2019; childhood and youth and why no more is said; discusses Jesus&#x2019; personal affect; notes the qualities of his teaching, especially in the parables; emphasizes his reservations about the miracles he performs; and analyzes how he differentially addressed men, women, children, and the aged. Johnson outlines the &#x201c;new ten commandments&#x201d; that Jesus introduced in deed as well as word and with which he intended to prepare his followers not to change the world but to enter the kingdom of God. Lastly, Johnson inspects the Passion, the Resurrection, and their aftermath to Pentecost with intelligent faith. An all-but-unalloyed (the Catholic Johnson favors women in priesthood) gift to all believing Christians. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Old Turtle</h2><p>All of nature argues about the forms of God, so people are sent as a reminder of all that God is, although they do not seem to understand the message themselves.</p><p>When all of creation--trees, stones, ants, the sky, fish&#x2014;-begins arguing over who or what God is, quiet Old Turtle is the only one who has the wisdom and ability to see beyond herself to capture the essence. The debate escalates until Old Turtle finally speaks: "STOP!" She accepts and incorporates the beliefs of all the creatures: "God is indeed deep," she says to the fish in the sea, "and much higher than high," she tells the mountains. "God is gentle and powerful. Above all things and within all things... God IS." Old Turtle, after silencing the crowds with her understanding, makes a prediction about the appearance of a new "family of beings" in the world. These beings, human beings, do appear, and soon are fighting among themselves over the nature of God. It is only when people start listening to the mountains and winds and stones and stars that they actually begin to hear--and to heal the earth. <p> A graceful fable, with elegant, dreamlike watercolors by illustrator Cheng-Khee Chee, Douglas Wood's modern-day classic makes a hushed but strong environmental statement, as well as a plea for universal acceptance.

But what about your Social Security number? Your credit card numbers? Your bank account statements? Your personal health data? You may think this information is also secure, but if you've ever ordered anything over the Internet, or if your credit card is on file at the local video store just in case you never return that copy of <i>Titanic</i>, or if you throw out bank statements without shredding them, then this information is now in the public domain and can easily be discovered and used against you by a private eye, a computer hacker, or even a vengeful neighbor or former lover. Once people gain control of even a shred of your personal information, they can gain control of your life. They can transform this information into access to your assets, your loved ones, even your identity. And once your privacy is gone, there's very little you can do to get it back.<br><br>J. J. Luna, a highly trained and experienced security consultant, can show you how to achieve the privacy you crave, whether you just want to shield yourself from casual scrutiny or take your life savings and disappear without a trace. He reveals the shocking secrets that private detectives use to uncover information, and then shows you how to safeguard against them.<br><br>Filled with vivid real-life stories drawn from the headlines and from Luna's own consulting experience, <i>How to Be Invisible</i> is the essential guide to preserving your personal security. Privacy is commonly lamented as the first casualty of the Information Age-- but that doesn't mean you have to stand for it.<br></p><p>It's hard to say how private investigators would react to books like J. J. Luna's <i>How to Be Invisible</i>--while it makes their jobs a lot harder, most of them are paid by the hour. If you want to withdraw from the snooping eyes of the government, corporations, stalking ex-boyfriends, or practically anyone else, this practical, down-to-earth guide will help you and your family vanish. It's not a glamorous James Bond life Mr. Luna is inviting you to take part in; it's probably much like the life you're living right now. Spending much of the early part of the book frightening the reader with tales of stalkers and mistaken identities, the author successfully makes his case that a few adjustments to an individual's personal information flow can make a life-or-death difference. While getting his plan off the ground will take a bit of planning and effort (you have to move at least once to clear your trail), it is sustainable and worthwhile even for those who think they have nothing to hide. Learn about anonymous travel and purchase, using trusts and corporations to keep your assets private, and how recent laws (the book's date of publication is 2000) significantly affect older methods of guaranteeing privacy. Luna makes no claim to know the law where you live and suggests that you consult a trusted local attorney before implementing most of his advice. Just knowing how easily a criminal can learn about and exploit your personal information will make you want to do just that. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>J. J.

In Logic for Lawyers: A Guide to Clear Legal Thinking, Senior U.S. Circuit Judge Ruggero J. Aldisert tells how to use legal reasoning to persuade judges and juries. <p>A 30-year veteran of the bench, Aldisert helps litigators understand and apply the elements of legal logic. Using these skills, you can argue more persuasively--both in briefs and before the court. And just as critically, you can also expose flaws in adversaries' arguments. The result? A competitive edge in the courtroom. </p><p>Rather than miring readers in exotic formulas and theories often found in logic texts, Aldisert explains in broad strokes the basics of logic and its application to legal thinking. You'll gain important insight into the mental processes we use in "thinking like a lawyer."</p></p><p>Developing good legal reasoning habits is essential to a quality law practice. Judge Aldisert examines legal thinking from a variety of perspectives to help guide lawyers through appropriate reasoning patterns. One Amazon.com reviewer says the book "provides a shortcut to understanding the basics of legal reasoning, including the common law doctrine of precedent, identifying weaknesses in legal arguments, and fashioning winning arguments through syllogisms." <i>--David Marshall Nissman, J.D.</i>"...an exposition of how the use or misuse of logic promotes or impairs the development of law..." -- <i>Jeffrey W. Grove, Professor, Indiana University School of Law</i><br><br>"Logic for Lawyers is the product of a keen mind that has benefitted from opportunities to engage in and examine legal thinking from a variety of perspectives. This volume fills a surprising void in the current legal literature." -- <i>Mark A. Nordenberg, Chancellor, University of Pittsburgh</i><br><br>"Logic for Lawyers points out the fallacies of which we are all guilty from time to time....It will aid in avoiding the development of bad habits in legal reasoning." -- <i>Elizabeth H. Patterson, Professor, Georgetown University Law Center</i><br><br>"The book's constituency includes all who labor in the law--from apprentice to master craftsman--and care about understanding their work and doing a credible job." --<i>Jeffrey W. Grove, Professor, Indiana University School of Law, Indianapolis</i></p><h2>Wagons West : Independence</h2><p>When the Panic of 1837 creates hard times, a dauntless band of pioneering men and women journey from Long Island to Missouri with the hopes of eventually finding a better future in the rich Oregon Territory.</p><p><b>Dana Fuller Ross</b> was the pseudonym of Noel Bertram Gerson. Gerson, a prolific writer, wrote numerous works under many pseudonyms including the White Indian novels, which he wrote as Donald Clayton Porter.Independence! is a 70mm wide-screen sort of novel with a cast of thousands and lots of familiar faces in the leading roles. It&#39;s all a little larger than life and much neater, but a good yarn. Reader Tom Morgan plunges into this epic with assurance in a light, pleasant voice well-suited to prolonged listening. His character voices are lightly drawn but consistent enough for clarity, and he commands a wide range of regional accents. He makes little effort to differentiate female voices as such, but that&#39;s a minor quibble. Neat packaging and production wrap up an attractive selection for light listening. J.N.

A wire had been tightly wound around her neck. The strongest suspect, because he stood to benefit by the death of this wealthy old woman, was her protege, the famous Dr. Janney. Just before her death he received a strange caller--one whose name he would not divulge. Ellery Queen, having come to the hospital to visit his old friend Dr. Minchen, had been present during the time of the murder. He immediately took over the case. Besides the problem of Dr. Janney and his caller, Ellery found himself confronted with still another--why had Abby Doorn and her housekeeper quarreled continuously for twenty years? The housekeeper admitted she hated the old woman, and with a religious fanaticism declared she was an evil old woman who had received only what she deserved.</p><p><p><strong>Ellery Queen</strong> is a pseudonym used by two American cousins from Brooklyn--Daniel Nathan, alias Frederic Dannay (1905-1982), and Manford (Emanuel) Lepofsky, alias Manfred Bennington Lee (1905-1971)--to write detective fiction.

He lives with his family in Sarasota, Florida.<br>Chapter One<br>Eight months later <br>&nbsp;<br>It's called Terror Town.<br>&nbsp;<br>No one remembers how it got the name. Probably a cop, maybe a frightened resident.<br>&nbsp;<br>The residents, almost all black, face the reality of drive-by shootings, prostitution, intimidation, extortion, and drug dealers who rule and terrorize the South Side neighborhood.<br>&nbsp;<br>Terror Town is roughly bordered on the north by Seventy-fourth Street, on the south by Seventy-ninth Street, and on the east and west by Yates and Exchange.<br>&nbsp;<br>Residents are eleven times more likely to be victims of violent crime than those living in the rest of the city. More than half the men in Terror Town are unemployed. More than 60 percent of the children in Terror Town are born to unwed mothers, and the infant mortality rate is double that of white Chicago.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Black P Stones have ruled Terror Town for almost half a century, their leaders going to prison, being released, being replaced. Their life spans are shorter than the Chicago mobsters' of the 1920s. They call themselves The Nation.<br>&nbsp;<br>The symbols of the P Stones' graffiti cover the cracked walls of six-flat apartment buildings, billboards, and abandoned storefronts. The pyramid with an eye and the rising sun, the number 7, the crescent moon, and the five-pointed star. Big bad brother is watching you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Branches of the Stones roam and ride. In Terror Town and nearby neighborhoods are the Apache Stones, whose mark is simply the letters APS; the ElRukns; the Jet Black Stones; the Titanic Stones; the Ruben Night Stones; the Jabari Stones; and the Black Stone Villains.<br>&nbsp;<br>The police enter the streets of Terror Town with the same foreboding as Marines in Baghdad. Police have been ambushed and gunned down in this city within a city.<br>&nbsp;<br>There is a Muslim presence on Kingston Street that distributes food and clothing monthly. There is a library on Seventy-fifth that provides sanctuary for those who seek safety for a few hours.<br>&nbsp;<br>There are businesses and banks and churches that struggle to prosper, provide, and prepare.<br>&nbsp;<br>And there are the police, who simply try to keep the sky from falling.<br>&nbsp;<br>Terror Town at twilight. A Friday afternoon. Anita Mills, her baby in her arms, stepped out of the bank on Seventy-fifth Street.<br>&nbsp;<br>The cash was folded and tucked into her pocket, deep. She knew better than to put it in her purse, which could be ripped from her arm.<br>&nbsp;<br>The street was busy. Across from Anita, a group of loiterers in front of a video shop, men of all ages, talking, laughing, smoking, or standing sullen and watching the cars go by. Coming toward her from the right, a mother or grandmother, shopping bags in one hand, a little girl at her side. The woman, heavy, bulbous legs, each step limping agony.<br>&nbsp;<br>The cab was waiting at the sidewalk. Anita had paid him for the trip there and would pay him for the trip to Royal Murtagh's office. The driver had a thick Jamaican accent and a nervous smile. It was late spring and warm but not warm enough to bring on the beads of sweat on the man's ebony forehead. Drugs? Nerves? Who knew? Who cared? Anita was about to escape.<br>&nbsp;<br>Carmen stirred, asleep on her shoulder, nine months old, lighter than Anita, lighter than the man who was the baby's father. She knew that people often thought she was the babysitter of a white child when she took Carmen out of Terror Town.<br>&nbsp;<br>Five steps, maybe six.<br>&nbsp;<br>And they were there. In front of her. Anita stopped. Two men, both lean, both wearing Halloween masks depicting George W. Bush, both holding guns pointed at Anita.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Now, fast, bitch," said the man on her left. His voice was young.<br>&nbsp;<br>The cab she was heading for tore rubber and pulled away, clipping the walker of an old man crossing the street, sending the walker flying in the air like a rocket toward the cluster of men in front of the video store.<br>&nbsp;<br>Anita didn't, couldn't, speak. She clutched her sleeping baby, and shook her head "no."<br>&nbsp;<br>The man spoke again: "Give now or I shoot the fuckin' baby in the fuckin' head. I mean it."<br>&nbsp;<br>He pressed the gun against the top of Carmen's head and put his face inches from Anita's.<br>&nbsp;<br>Anita was light-headed. The woman with the bad legs and the child shouted, "Leave the baby be."<br>&nbsp;<br>The second gunman turned his weapon on the woman with the bad legs.<br>&nbsp;<br>The man with the gun to Carmen's head ripped the purse from Anita's shoulder.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now run, she willed. Not her. Them. Run. No one's going to chase you. Run and find out that you got twenty-eight dollars and change. Run, damn you.<br>&nbsp;<br>The second gunman turned toward Anita again. Anita was aware of people watching the show, something to talk about, to witness, better than television in a dark room.<br>&nbsp;<br>The second gunman tugged at the sleeve of the first, the talker.<br>&nbsp;<br>"What? Let's go."<br>&nbsp;<br>The second gunman reached for the pocket of Anita's jeans. She turned away. The first gunman grabbed her hair and turned her toward him. Carmen woke up and began to cry. Anita felt the hand go into her pocket, plunging deep, violating her body, her future, her hope.<br>&nbsp;<br>"No," she shouted, pulling herself away.<br>&nbsp;<br>The man with his hand in her pocket almost fell over, the gun in his right hand giving off a popping sound that she recognized.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Fuck," said the first gunman.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Oh, no, dammit, no," the second man said. It was the first thing he had said. She recognized the voice.<br>&nbsp;<br>She went back hard, dragging the man with his hand in her pocket to the ground. She held the baby to her chest as she fell on her back, her head hitting the sidewalk with a thunk.<br>&nbsp;<br>Too many things to do, to think about. No time. The baby was crying harder. That was good.<br>&nbsp;<br>The twilight was turning black. The hand came out of her pocket.<br>&nbsp;<br>"You got it?" asked the first gunman.<br>&nbsp;<br>The second man didn't answer.<br>&nbsp;<br>Anita blinked. Something warm and wet was in her eyes but she thought that the second man, the one whose voice she recognized, was holding the envelope he had taken from her pocket.<br>&nbsp;<br>The bullet had entered her left cheek just below the eye. It didn't hurt. She tried to hold out her hand. The second gunman hesitated. She could see his dark eyes looking down at her through the dark wetness.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I didn't--" he started to say.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Move ass," said the first gunman.<br>&nbsp;<br>The bank door opened.<br>&nbsp;<br>It had been no more than fifteen seconds since Anita had left the bank. She couldn't see it, but the old man in the blue uniform stepped out of the bank, crouching low, gun extended.<br>&nbsp;<br>She heard the shot, sensed the robbers running. Heard another shot.<br>&nbsp;<br>Voices now. Anita couldn't see.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Oh, Lord," said a woman, the woman with the bad legs.<br>&nbsp;<br>Her name was Etta Bartholomew. The frightened child at her side was her granddaughter Dinah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Anita tried to speak, to say something over the crying of her baby. A name. Anita wanted to hand Carmen to the woman whose voice she had heard, but her arms no longer worked. She repeated the name and then another name.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Rest easy," said Etta, knees already in pain from the act of kneeling. "Ambulance be here quick."<br>&nbsp;<br>The woman took the baby gently from Anita's arms. Anita wanted to kiss her daughter. It would be the last time. She knew it. She was vaguely aware of Carmen being passed from the woman kneeling next to her to the young girl who had been at the woman's side.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Your baby'll be fine," said Etta.<br>&nbsp;<br>Anita said the name again. She was twenty years old. She would be dead in seconds. That she knew. It definitely wasn't real and there was not nearly the pain she might have expected.<br>&nbsp;<br>Anita said the name again.<br>&nbsp;<br>The woman next to her repeated the name.<br>&nbsp;<br>Anita felt the woman's hand in hers. As the world flickered light to dark to light again, she tried to tighten her grip. And then she died.<br>&nbsp;<br>The woman touched the dead woman's check and struggled to her feet, reaching out to take the crying baby from her granddaughter.<br>&nbsp;<br>"What did she say?" asked the girl.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Sounded like she said, 'Abe Lieberman,'" said the woman.<br>&nbsp;<br>Spaulding Minor, lean, stoop-shouldered, dark Pakistani brown, had said that the crazy man had come every Thursday for the past five weeks just before six. It was just before six.<br>&nbsp;<br>And through the door walked the man.<br>&nbsp;<br>Spaulding Minor, whose real name was Anwar Mushariff, looked through the window of the Dollar-Or-Less store he owned at the old man across the street eating a hot dog and talking to the short, fat pushcart vendor, who was wiping his hands on his white apron.<br>&nbsp;<br>The crazy man stopped a dozen feet from the counter behind which Anwar stood.<br>&nbsp;<br>When Anwar Mushariff bought the Dollar-Or-Less six years earlier, he had inherited the name that went with it. The Pakistanis in the Devon Avenue Community called him Spaulding Minor as a joke. The Indians in the neighborhood called him Spaulding Minor as a bigger joke. Anwar's grandchildren, those old enough to talk, called him Spaulding Minor because everyone else did, the Bangladeshi, Thai, Croatians, and the others.<br>&nbsp;<br>Only the sad-looking policeman had called him Mr. Mushariff.<br>&nbsp;<br>Though he corrected family, friends, and customers with a weary resignation, Anwar was of a mixed mind about the name. It sounded American, which he now was, but it belonged to someone else, not even anyone in the family of the woman and her father from whom he had bought the store. Spaulding Minor Dollar-Or-Less stores were, for a few years, a franchise of little success, with four stores, one each in Detroit, Dayton, Topeka, and Chicago. All had failed. The one in Chicago had been purchased by a woman and her son, Jews named Goldfarb, who then sold it to Anwar, who was told that no one had ever called the son Spaulding Minor.<br>&nbsp;<br>Slowly the crazy man started moving again toward the counter behind which Anwar was standing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Anwar made the store profit by getting about half the items he sold from the overstock and unwanted, unsalable inventory of the store owners on Devon and the other half from dollar stores on the South Side where he bought batches of items on sale for as little as a quarter each and sold them for the dollar.<br>&nbsp;<br>As the crazy man moved yet closer, Anwar rang up the purchase of three plastic cameras for a grim, fat white woman with stringy hair and missing teeth. The woman was jabbering something in an American accent that Anwar had difficulty understanding. At the moment, he wasn't even trying. He simply said, "Oh yes," when she spoke.<br>&nbsp;<br>Across the street he saw the thin old man with white hair and a matching mustache. The man was not impressive. He looked like a sad baggy-eyed spaniel. He doubted if the man could deal with the problem. Anwar was certain that the police had assigned the relic of a man because they had little consideration for a Pakistani storekeeper. But, perhaps, he should be grateful that they had assigned anyone at all.<br>&nbsp;<br>The fat woman with stringy hair and missing teeth didn't see the crazy man behind her. She jabbered on.<br>&nbsp;<br>Had it not been for Mr. Habib, the president of the Merchants Association, it was likely that the police would have paid no attention to Anwar's complaint and that of the other merchants on the North Side neighborhood known as Gandhi Marg or Mohammed Ali Jinnah Way, as it had been known as Golda Meier Boulevard when it was the main shopping area for Jews who lived on the North Side.<br>&nbsp;<br>Anwar was sure that Mr. Habib, who owned the largest sari shop in the neighborhood, was acting out of both a paternal concern for a local merchant and a fear that the person Anwar and the others had described might extend the number of shops he regularly visited, extend them right up the street to Mr. Habib's own sari shop.<br>&nbsp;<br>Anwar, however, was not going to risk all that he worked for on the protection of Mr. Habib and the skinny man across the street. He owed it to his family, to himself, to his pride to be prepared. Was he afraid? Certainly, but he was also determined.<br>&nbsp;<br>Determination faltered when Anwar looked up at the crazy man, who now stood directly behind the fat woman, who said, "So I says to him, Barton, like you know the difference between a box with a little pinny hole and a Germany camera."<br>&nbsp;<br>Anwar's eyes met those of the crazy man. The man was tall, taller than the son of Kareem, the man who owned the DVD, video, and CD store a block away. Kareem's son played basket-ball for the University of Illinois in Chicago. It was a game Anwar did not understand, but he knew that it required tall people like Kareem's son.<br>&nbsp;<br>The crazy man was also wide, like the chest of drawers that stood in Anwar's bedroom, the chest his wife had brought with her from Pakistan.<br>&nbsp;<br>The fat woman stopped in mid sentence, looked at the shopkeeper's eyes, and then glanced over her shoulder to see what the man she knew as Spaulding Minor was looking at.<br>&nbsp;<br>Behind her, no more than three feet away, stood a huge bald man in a floor-length coat that looked as if it were made of the same pale brown material they had packed the onions in when she still lived on the farm in Wrightsboro back in Tennessee.<br>&nbsp;<br>The bald man smiled at her. She didn't like that smile. He blocked her way. She would have gladly been almost anywhere else, with the possible exception of Wrightsboro.<br>&nbsp;<br>Around the man's neck a rough black cord held a wooden cross the size of a small book. The cross lay flat against the man's chest.<br>&nbsp;<br>She couldn't tell how old he was. She didn't care. She just wanted to escape. The man said something to her. He was bending over, his face a few inches from hers, his breath warm and not much different from rotting onions.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Are you washed in the blood of the lamb?" the man whispered.<br>&nbsp;<br>"What?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Have you accepted Jesus as your one and true savior?" the man said.<br>&nbsp;<br>The woman backed into the counter, knocking over a display of bags of salted peanuts. Anwar caught the display before it fell and the woman shuffled sideways in the space between the counter and the bald man.<br>&nbsp;<br>Anwar looked out the window again as the fat woman waddled toward the front door with her plastic bag containing three plastic cameras.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Repent and be saved," the bald man said to her.<br>&nbsp;<br>She banged through the door and hurried to her left down Western Avenue.<br>&nbsp;<br>Across the street, through the window, Anwar could see the old man eating another hot dog.<br>&nbsp;<br>It wasn't a hot dog. Detective Sergeant Abe Lieberman was eating a knockwurst at Leo's stand.<br>&nbsp;<br>Through the evening rush-hour traffic, Abe stood in his knee-length camel-color wool coat. Abe's eyes met those of Anwar Mushariff, aka Spaulding Minor.<br>&nbsp;<br>The ...</p><h2>The First Emancipator: The Forgotten Story of Robert Carter, the Founding Father Who Freed His Slaves</h2><p>Robert Carter III, the grandson of Tidewater legend Robert &#x201c;King&#x201d; Carter, was born into the highest circles of Virginia&#x2019;s Colonial aristocracy. He was neighbor and kin to the Washingtons and Lees and a friend and peer to Thomas Jefferson and George Mason. But on September 5, 1791, Carter severed his ties with this glamorous elite at the stroke of a pen. In a document he called his Deed of Gift, Carter declared his intent to set free nearly five hundred slaves in the largest single act of liberation in the history of American slavery before the Emancipation Proclamation.<br><br>How did Carter succeed in the very action that George Washington and Thomas Jefferson claimed they fervently desired but were powerless to effect? And why has his name all but vanished from the annals of American history? In this haunting, brilliantly original work, Andrew Levy traces the confluence of circumstance, conviction, war, and passion that led to Carter&#x2019;s extraordinary act.<br><br>At the dawn of the Revolutionary War, Carter was one of the wealthiest men in America, the owner of tens of thousands of acres of land, factories, ironworks&#x2013;and hundreds of slaves. But incrementally, almost unconsciously, Carter grew to feel that what he possessed was not truly his. In an era of empty Anglican piety, Carter experienced a feverish religious visionthat impelled him to help build a church where blacks and whites were equals.<br><br> In an age of publicly sanctioned sadism against blacks, he defied convention and extended new protections and privileges to his slaves. As the war ended and his fortunes declined, Carter dedicated himself even more fiercely to liberty, clashing repeatedly with his neighbors, his friends, government officials, and, most poignantly, his own family.<br><br>But Carter was not the only humane master, nor the sole partisan of freedom, in that freedom-loving age. Why did this troubled, spiritually torn man dare to do what far more visionary slave owners only dreamed of? In answering this question, Andrew Levy teases out the very texture of Carter&#x2019;s life and soul&#x2013;the unspoken passions that divided him from others of his class, and the religious conversion that enabled him to see his black slaves in a new light.<br><br>Drawing on years of painstaking research, written with grace and fire, The First Emancipator is a portrait of an unsung hero who has finally won his place in American history. It is an astonishing, challenging, and ultimately inspiring book.</p><p>ANDREW LEVY was born in Mount Holly, New Jersey, in 1962. He received an M.A. from the Johns Hopkins Writing Seminars in 1986 and a Ph.D. in literature from the University of Pennsylvania in 1991.

He posed for it in 1749 or 1750 in Thomas Hudson&#x2019;s London studio, and two hundred fifty years later, it is easy enough to imagine what the painter was thinking. Probably, Carter was just another colonial gentleman, raw but wealthy, and the portraitist knew his type, and knew their vanities. And so Carter was draped in a billowing gold suit and silver cape, brown hair neatly tied back and powdered gray, smirking, a mask dangling from the tapered fingers of his left hand. The suit is a century out of date, as if Carter were a courtier to Charles I, or masquerading as one. He looks like he is on his way to a ball, to a lifetime of balls, and has stopped just for a moment before donning the mask.<br><br>It is an extraordinary portrait. It takes two glances before one even notices Carter&#x2019;s head, because brilliant shades of silver and gold cover more than half the canvas: Carter is dressed like money. And Carter&#x2019;s mask is a wonder: red-rouged cheeks, dark drawn eyebrows, full red lips, and starkly pale otherwise, a minstrel mask in reverse, as if the masquerade Carter was about to attend required him to perform the role of a white man. Finally, however, Carter&#x2019;s face draws the observer. The smirk is no ordinary smirk: it has Mona Lisa mystery. And the eyes are huge and dark, and imply something open and unfinished, something that resisted being posed as the young patriarch on the rise.<br><br>When Carter stood for this portrait, he was twenty-one and poised for a brilliant, even notorious, career. He had wealth: more than sixty-five thousand acres of New World soil and more than one hundred slaves. He had family: his grandfather was Robert &#x201c;King&#x201d; Carter, who, in his own brilliant and notorious career, acquired large swaths of the Virginian frontier and distributed huge parcels of land and slaves to his progeny. He had connections: his uncles and aunts had intermarried with some of Virginia&#x2019;s richest families, the Fitzhughs, Pages, Churchills, and Harrisons; his father&#x2019;s estate resided within twenty miles of both Stratford Hall&#x2014;the Lee manse&#x2014;and Pope&#x2019;s Creek, where George Washington was born and reared. And lastly, he had arrogance, or some quality worse than arrogance: his cousin John Page, who would later become one of the first governors of the state of Virginia, called him an &#x201c;inconceivable illiterate and also corrupted and vicious.&#x201d;<br><br>But he also had another quality, something that drew upon the arrogance that wealth and connections provided, but that fought against the destiny that wealth and connections presented. As much as any Virginian of his era, Robert Carter exemplified what it meant to be powerful and wealthy in prewar America: he looked and acted like the kind of aristocrat who needed to fall so that the United States and its new heroes could rise. At the same time, Carter was about to undertake the same education in manners and society that trained other Virginians to become our great, hallowed Revolutionaries. He read the same books and the same newspapers, sold his tobacco on the same markets, negotiated the same land deals. He attended the same political debates, and voted&#x2014;when he possessed a vote&#x2014;for the Revolutionary path almost every time. He shared a pastor with George Washington, and teachers with Thomas Jefferson. He even played alongside Jefferson in a musical quartet, the future composer of the Declaration of Independence tuning his fiddle to Carter&#x2019;s harpsichord amid the echoes of the Virginia royal governor&#x2019;s long ballroom.<br><br>That Carter chose to transcend the conservative roots of his childhood and young adulthood, then, is no surprise. Many did. The surprise lies elsewhere: why did the same republican influences that moved the founders instead move Carter to become their mirror image, capable of doing what they could not, and unable to do what they did so well?<br><br>2<br><br>For John Carter, the first Carter to plant himself in Virginian soil, the logic of emigration was irrefutable. On the one hand, he was a stubborn royalist, a member of a family of London vintners who supported the monarchy, and Charles I would soon lose his head to Cromwell&#x2019;s revolution. On the other hand, he was the youngest son in his family, which meant that, according to the ancient law of primogeniture, he would receive little of his father&#x2019;s wealth. Instead, he would be expected to join the clergy, take the bar, or serve under his brothers in the family firm. Under the old system, he had little future; under the new, it seemed, he had even less.<br><br>The Virginia Colony, however, was another story. By 1635, the year that twenty-two-year-old John Carter sailed to the New World, almost three decades had elapsed since a few score of merchants, soldiers, and indentured servants had begun settling on the banks of a wide river they named after King James I. Over the course of those three decades, the free English of Virginia, who numbered in the low thousands, kept the Indians at bay, &#x201c;seasoned&#x201d; themselves to the mysterious, infectious American climate, and transformed their family names and modest merchant fortunes into large tracts of American soil. They filled the new colony with little wooden homes, one-and-a-half-story frames with steep cat-slide roofs like they remembered from the English West Country, or multichamber log cabins that undulated with the ground beneath them. They built orchards and laid out cornfields, but mostly they seeded tobacco, in thousands upon thousands of tiny hills each no bigger than a small child, each requiring the care of a small child. To tend those fields, they imported so many Irish, convicts, and recalcitrant indentured servants that reformers on both sides of the Atlantic began to regard Virginia as &#x201c;a sinke to drayen England of her filth and scum.&#x201d;<br><br>It was an age of great possibility, and great horror. On July 30, 1619, in a small brick church in Jamestown, the first democratically elected assembly in North America gathered, twenty-two men calling themselves &#x201c;Burgesses.&#x201d; Three weeks later, perhaps fifty yards down a short embankment to the Jamestown wharf, a Dutch man-of-war delivered the first &#x201c;twenty and odd&#x201d; Africans to the continent, men with Spanish names purchased to alleviate the labor shortage. John Carter, possessing a younger brother&#x2019;s hunger for advancement and wealth, acclimated himself quickly. By 1641, he was elected to the House of Burgesses representing Upper Norfolk, frontier land well northwest of Jamestown. By 1652, he had moved to the Northern Neck, the verdant spit of land reaching out into the Chesapeake between the wide Potomac and Rappahannock rivers. There he had purchased 1,300 acres of land on a windblown, pine-covered little peninsula on the Rappahannock: an exposed place, more bay than land almost, defiantly cool in a Virginia summer, and covered with rich, loamy soil that held tobacco plants like nothing he could have possessed in England.<br><br>He built a one-room wooden house on the edge of his windblown peninsula, coated it with stucco made of oyster shells, and called the surrounding farm Corotoman, after the local Indian tribe. Three miles inland, he built a church he named after Christ, another one-room wooden affair. By the time he died, in 1669, he had married five times, produced an unrecorded number of children (four of whom survived him), and served in the House of Burgesses and as a member of the powerful, royally appointed Governor&#x2019;s Council. As well, he convinced the crown to allow him to &#x201c;patent&#x201d; more than six thousand acres of land, and he led an exploratory force against the Rappahannock Indians. Perhaps most important, for himself and his children, he left behind a significant legacy of &#x201c;tithables&#x201d;&#x2014;still mostly white indentured servants, but now also African-born servants for whom no indenture contract promised freedom.<br><br>Upon his death, however, he committed the same error of tradition that had inspired his own restlessness: he left control of most of his property to his oldest surviving son, John, and left his youngest surviving son, Robert, with only a thousand acres of land around Corotoman and six years of education in London in the keep of a merchant family named Bailey. One look at an early portrait of Robert Carter I, and a modern reader can easily grasp how little the obstacle of a small inheritance would have mattered to him: he poses in his older brother&#x2019;s periwig, holding his older brother&#x2019;s sword, both symbols of family leadership, and the sneer on his face implies that he would rather use the latter than surrender the former.<br><br>And when his older brother died, in 1690, and Robert Carter I earned the sword and periwig in earnest, he undertook what is arguably one of the most extraordinary careers in the history of American capital and politics. One year later, he was elected to the House of Burgesses, and he made his reputation there by delivering fearless speeches against the power of English land agents and by inspiring the construction of a &#x201c;family&#x201d; bloc of voters&#x2014;Byrds, Churchills, and Fairfaxes, among others&#x2014;who would govern Virginia for two generations. By 1696, he became Speaker. By 1700, he was appointed to the Governor&#x2019;s Council. By 1703, he was taunting English power with even greater ferocity, denouncing Royal Governor Francis Nicholson with such vehemence that the startled Queen recalled her charge.<br><br>Shuttling back and forth between London (where he befriended, among others, the great philosopher John Locke) and Virginia, Carter acquired one lucrative administrative post after another: treasurer, naval officer, receiver of duties in the Rappahannock River, and, in 1702, agent for the proprietary of the Northern Neck, a position he had once ...</p><h2>400 Wood Boxes: The Fine Art of Containment &amp; Concealment (500 Series)</h2><p>Featuring 400 outstanding works that range from traditional to wildly contemporary, this superb gallery celebrates the art of the wooden box.

An understanding of who these prehistoric inhabitants were and how they lived would unlock the secret of our continent's past. Because there are no written records of their activities, which date back perhaps 30,000 years, historians must piece together these ancient lives by careful examination of all available evidence, more of which is continually being unearthed. Through such meticulous research and his skillful and articulate pen, C. Keith Wilbur brings to life the vanished cultures of the Woodland Indians. Focusing mainly on the period from 1000 B.C. to 1500 A.D., his text and illustrations combine to tell of these Indians' leadership, religious beliefs, seasonal celebrations, agriculture and warfare.<br></p><h2>God of Becoming and Relationship: The Dynamic Nature of Process Theology</h2><p><p><strong>You no longer have to choose between what you know and what you believe&#x2015;an accessible introduction to a theological game-changer.</strong></p><blockquote><p>"I wrote this book for you if you want to be able to locate your life in a single, encompassing story, one that includes everything from the first moment the universe began until yesterday, a narrative that embraces deepest personal meaning, a yearning to love and be loved, a quest for social justice and compassion."<br>&#x2015;from the Introduction</p></blockquote><p>Much of what you were told you should believe when you were younger forces you to choose between your spirit and your intellect, between science and religion, between morality and dogma: unchanging laws of nature vs. miracles that sound magical; a good God vs. the tragedies that strike all living creatures; a God who knows the future absolutely vs. an open future that you help to shape through your choices.</p><p>This fascinating introduction to Process Theology from a Jewish perspective shows that these are false choices. Inspiring speaker, spiritual leader and philosopher Rabbi Bradley Shavit Artson presents an overview of what Process Theology is and what it can mean for your spiritual life. He explains how Process Theology can break you free from the strictures of ancient Greek and medieval European philosophy, allowing you to see all creation not as this or that, us or them, but as related patterns of energy through which we connect to everything. Armed with Process insights and tools, you can break free from outdated religious dichotomies and affirm that your religiosity, your spirit, your mind and your ethics all strengthen and refine each other.</p></p><p><p><strong>Rabbi Bradley Shavit Artson, DHL</strong>, (www.bradartson.com) an inspiring speaker and educator, holds the Abner and Roslyn Goldstine Dean's Chair of the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies and is vice president of American Jewish University in Los Angeles.

This discovery represented arguably the most significant manuscript discovery of the twentieth century for the study of the New Testament and Christian origins. Of all the texts in this Nag Hammadi Library, none has been more celebrated than the Gospel of Thomas - a Gospel that has played a crucial role in the newly emerging view of early Christianity as a very diverse phenomenon and in the recent revival of historical Jesus studies. Now, after more than fifty years of study, the best text and the best translation of Thomas are presented here in user-friendly form by the Berlin Working Group for Coptic Gnostic Writings, with Stephen J. Patterson and James M. Robinson. In addition, two essays have been included for persons who may be unfamiliar with this new Gospel or with events that led to its discovery and publication. The first, by Patterson, is a general introduction to the Gospel of Thomas as it appears fifty years after its discovery. The second, by Robinson, tells the fascinating story of that discovery itself by one who was directly involved in bringing this new Gospel to light. An annotated list &#34;for further reading&#34; completes the volume. Stephen J. Patterson is Associate Professor of New Testament at Eden Theological Seminary and author of The God of Jesus: The Historical Jesus and the Search for Meaning (Trinity Press). James M.

The Yoga Sutras of Pata�jali: A New Translation and Commentary</h2><p>The Yoga Sutras of Maharshi Patanjali are an elegant description of the expansion of consciousnss and the psychological, emotional, and physical transformations involved. Many commentators have mistaken the sutras for steps to enlghtenment, believing it necessary to renounce normal life and force the mind into silence. Nothing could be further from the truth. This translation and commentary corrects this unfortunate distortion, clearly revealing the power of the sutras to illuminate the nature of the Self and brings to light the true pupose and meaning of Pantanjali's words. <p> The Yoga Sutras do not contain the actual techniques to achieve enlightenment, but do describe what happens when proper tools are correctly applied. The techniques themselves have always been passed on through personal instruction, one enlivened heart to another.</p></p><p>In an instant of frozen time, no longer than the gap between two heartbeats, a being fully and permanently in contact with the Source Universe shared his vision with me. This was a free gift, a wordless joining of his infinite mind with mine.

I am an Unbounded Being. Living in a human body, I experience the Ascendant continually, twenty-four hours a day. The Thunder books are an attempt to explain this state of consciousness, to describe the Reality of the wonder of this experience.

He would run if he could, but if he does, his family dies. He is desperate; he doesn&#x2019;t know what to do.<br><br>It is up to Sean Dillon and the rest of the small band known as the Prime Minister&#x2019;s private army to think of a plan. Most particularly, it is up to their newest member, an intelligence captain and Afghan war hero named Sara Gideon, who thinks there just might be a way to pull it off.<br><br>But plans have a way of encountering&nbsp; the unexpected. And as the operation spins out, from Paris and Syria to Iran and the Saudi Arabian desert, there is very much that is unexpected indeed. And much blood that will be spilled.</p><p><b>Jack Higgins</b> lives on Jersey in the Channel Islands.An Iranian medical researcher, forced into applying his work on medical isotopes to nuclear weapons research, is dangerously close to perfecting a more powerful, cheaper nuclear bomb. The man&#x2019;s family is being held captive by the Iranian government so there&#x2019;s little chance he would ever defect, but the British (concerned about the possibility of Iran becoming a nuclear power) see a window of opportunity. The man is scheduled to be in Paris, and he happens to be acquainted with Sara Gideon, the intelligence agent who has recently joined the small band of operatives led by series hero Sean Dillon. Gideon and Dillon&#x2019;s mission: meet up with the man in Paris and convince him to turn over his research. Possibility of success: strong. Possibility of mishap leading to dire consequences and life-threatening danger: even stronger. This is another sturdy action thriller with political overtones from one of the masters of the genre. Fans of the long-running Dillon series will flock to this latest entry, and the reappearance of Sara Gideon (who was introduced in 2012&#x2019;s A Devil Is Waiting) injects the book with some serious new energy.

The Seven Sisters-a prestigious group of American colleges, whose members include fashion icons such as Katharine Hepburn, Jacqueline Kennedy, Ali MacGraw, and Meryl Streep-perfected a flair that spoke to an aspirational lifestyle filled with education, travel, and excitement. Their style, on campus and off, was synonymous with an intelligence and American grace that became a marker of national pride and status all over the world: from jeans and baggy shirts to Bermuda shorts and blazers, soft Shetland sweaters and saddle shoes, not to mention sleek suiting, pearls, elegant suitcases, kidskin gloves, kitten heels, and cashmere. "[The college girl's] contribution to fashion is as American as Coca-Cola, baseball and hitch-hiking," announced <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> in 1935. <br><br><i>Seven Sisters Style</i> explores the multifaceted foundations and metamorphosis of this style, from the early twentieth century through today. Was the Seven Sisters girl an East Coast Ivy Leaguer? A geek or a goddess? Radical or conservative? A tomboy or an American princess? In many ways, she was all of these and more. This book presents a treasure trove of stunning visuals, including those from the archives of the Seven Sisters colleges that illustrate their legacy and enduring reverberations on and off the runway, in Hollywood, and in popular culture. From Dior's tailored blazers, wrap skirts, and short socks and heels to Balenciaga's juxtaposing the argyle sweater, collared blouse, and sharp tailored blazer, and even Band of Outsiders' silk pajama tartans with oversized coats and collegiate wool hats and scarves, it is a look that continues to fascinate and inspire.</p><p>Rebecca C.

His head pounded. Tape bound his wrists and ankles to plasteel chains. <p></p>He had always known it would end horribly. Only the when, where, how, why, and by whom of it all had eluded him. <p></p>That fog was beginning to lift. <p></p>How had he gotten here, wherever <i>here</i> was? As though from a great distance, Sigmund watched himself quest for recent memories. Why was it such a struggle? <p></p>He remembered the pedestrian concourse of an open-air mall, shoppers streaming. They wore every color of the rainbow, clothing and hair and skin, in every conceivable combination and pattern. Overhead, fluffy clouds scudded across a clear blue sky. The sun was warm on his face. Work, for once, had been laid aside. He'd been content. <p></p>Happiness is the sworn enemy of vigilance. How could he have been so careless? <p></p>Sigmund forced open his eyes. He was in a nearly featureless room. Its walls, floor, and ceiling were resilient plastic. Light came from one wall. I could be anywhere, Sigmund thought-and then two details grabbed his attention. <p></p>The room wasn't quite a box. The glowing wall had a bit of a curve to it. <p></p>There were recessed handholds in walls, floor, and ceiling. <p></p>Panic struck. He was on a <i>spaceship</i>! Was gravity a hair higher than usual? Lower? He couldn't tell. <p></p>Plasteel chains clattered dully as Sigmund sat up. He had watched enough old movies to expect chains to clink. Even as the room spun around him and everything faded to black, he found the energy to feel cheated. <p></p>COLD PLASTIC PRESSED AGAINST Sigmund's cheek. He opened his eyes a crack to see the same spartan room. Cell. <p></p>This time he noticed that one link of his chains had been fused to a handhold in the deck. <p></p>Had he passed out from a panic attack? <i>Where was he? <p></p></i>Sigmund forced himself to breathe slowly and deeply until the new episode receded. Fear could only muddy his thoughts. More deep breaths. <p></p>He had never before blacked out from panic. He could not believe that <i>his</i> blackout stemmed from panic. Yes, his faint had closely followed the thought he might be aboard a spaceship. It <i>also</i> had occurred just after he had sat up. Sigmund remembered his thoughts having been fuzzy. They seemed sharper now. <p></p>He'd been drugged! Doped up and barely awake, he'd sat up too fast. <i>That</i> was why he had passed out. <p></p>More cautiously this time, Sigmund got into a sitting position. His head throbbed. He considered the pain dispassionately. Less disabling than the last time, he decided. Perhaps the drugs were wearing off. <p></p>Some odd corner of his mind felt shamed by his panic attacks. Most Earthborn had flatland phobia worse than he, and so what? True, he'd been born on Earth, but his parents had been all over Known Space. Somehow they took pleasure in strange scents, unfamiliar night skies, and wrong gravity. <p></p>On principle, Sigmund had been to the moon twice. He had had to know: Could he leave Earth should the need ever arise? The second time, it was to make sure the success of that first trip wasn't a fluke. <p></p>He listened carefully. The soft whir of a ventilation fan. Hints of conversation, unintelligible. His own heartbeat. None of the background powerplant hum that permeated the spaceships he'd been on. Gravity felt as normal as his senses could judge. <p></p>Recognizing facts, spotting patterns, drawing inferences . . . he managed, but slowly, as though his thoughts swam through syrup. Traces of drugs remained in his system. He forced himself to concentrate. <p></p>If this was a ship, it was still on Earth. Someone <i>meant</i> to panic him, Sigmund decided. Someone wanted something from him. Until they got it, he'd probably remain alive. <p></p><i>They</i>. <p></p>For as long as Sigmund could remember, there had always been some <i>they</i> to worry about. <p></p>But even as Sigmund formed that thought, he knew "always" wasn't quite correct. . . . <p></p>IN THE BEGINNING, <i>they</i> were unambiguous enough: the Kzinti. <p></p>The Third Man-Kzin War broke out in 2490, the year Sigmund was born. He was five before he knew what a Kzin was-something like an upright orange cat, taller and much bulkier than a man, with a naked, rat-like tail. By then, the aliens had been defeated. The Kzinti Patriarchy ceded two colony worlds to the humans as reparations. In Sigmund's lifetime, they had attacked human worlds three more times. They'd lost those wars, too. <p></p>Fafnir was one of the worlds that changed hands after the third war. His parents had wanderlust and not a trace of flatland phobia. They left him in the care of an aunt, and went to Fafnir in 2500 for an adventure. <p></p>And found one. <p></p>Conflict erupted that year between humans on Fafnir and the Kzinti settlers who had remained behind. His parents vanished, in hostilities that failed to rise to the level of a numeral in the official reckoning of Man- Kzin Wars. It was a mere "border incident." <p></p>Everyone knew the Kzinti ate their prey. <p></p>So <i>they</i>, for a long time, were Kzinti. Sigmund hated the ratcats, and everyone understood. And he hated his parents for abandoning him. The grief counselors told his aunt that that was normal. And he hated his aunt, as much as she reminded him of Mom-or perhaps because she did-for allowing Mom and Dad to leave him with her. <p></p>The same year his parents disappeared, the Puppeteers emerged from beyond the rim of Human Space. A species more unlike the Kzinti could not be imagined. Puppeteers looked like two-headed, three-legged, wingless ostriches. The heads on their sinuous necks reminded him of sock puppets. The brain, Aunt Susan told him, hid under the thick mop of mane between the massive shoulders. <p></p>So <i>they</i> came to include these other aliens, these harmless-seeming newcomers, because Sigmund didn't believe in coincidence. And then <i>they</i> came to include <i>all</i> aliens-because, really, how could anyone truly know otherwise? <p></p>That was when Aunt Susan took him to a psychotherapist. Sigmund remembered the stunned look on her face after his first session. After she spoke alone with the therapist. Sigmund remembered her sobbing all that night in her bedroom. <p></p>He had a sickness, or sicknesses, he couldn't spell, much less understand: a paranoid personality disorder. Monothematic delusion with delusional misidentication syndrome. He didn't know if he believed the supposed silver lining: that it was treatable. <p></p>What Sigmund did believe was the other consolation Dr. Swenson offered Aunt Susan-that paranoia is an affliction of the brightest. <p></p>In time, Sigmund understood. Trauma can cause stress can cause biochemical imbalances can cause mental illness. A day and a night asleep in an autodoc corrected the biochemical imbalance in his brain. But a single chemical tweak wasn't enough: Knowing the world is out to get you is its own stress. Three months of therapy with Dr . Swenson addressed the paranoid behaviors Sigmund had already learned. <p></p>Dr. Swenson was right: Sigmund <i>was</i> very smart. Smart enough to figure out what the therapist wanted to hear. Smart enough to learn what thoughts to keep to himself. <p></p>TREMBLING, SIGMUND TRIED AGAIN to shake off the drugs. Reliving old horrors served no useful purpose-especially now. He needed to focus. <p></p>Start with <i>them</i>. They weren't Kzinti: The room was too small. Kzinti would have gone crazy. <p></p><i>They</i> wanted something from him; how he responded might be the only control he had in this situation. Who might <i>they</i> be? <p></p>Others might see in him only a middle-aged, midlevel financial analyst. A United Nations bureaucrat. A misanthrope dressed always in black, in a world where everyone else wore vibrant colors. <p></p>Sigmund saw more. All those years ago, Dr. Swenson had been far more correct than he knew. Sigmund was more than bright. He was brilliant- in the mind, where it counted, not in gaudy display. <p></p>Who were <i>they</i>? Probably somebody Sigmund was investigating. That narrowed it down. The bribe-taking customs officials at Quito Spaceport? The sysadmin at the UN ID data center who moonlighted in identity laundering? <p></p>Sigmund's gut said otherwise. It was his other ongoing investigation: the Trojan Mafia. The gang, known by its reputed base in the Trojan Asteroids, engaged in every kind of smuggling, from artworks to weapons to experimental medicines. They killed for hire-and, more often, just to keep the authorities at bay. They were into extortion, money laundering . . . everything. Every other analyst in Investigations refused to touch them. <p></p>Surely that was <i>who</i>. <p></p><i>How</i> was more speculative. A "chance" encounter in the pedestrian mall near his home, he guessed, by someone with a fast-acting hypo-sedative. He stumbles; his assailant, to all appearances a Good Samaritan, helps him to the nearest transfer booth. <p></p>Where? Other than somewhere on Earth, Sigmund wasn't prepared to guess. On a world bristling with transfer booths, he could have been teleported instantaneously almost anywhere. <p></p>And when? Blinking to de-blur his vision, Sigmund raised his hands. His left wrist hurt-not much, but it hurt. The time display had frozen. Ironic that, since the subcutaneous control pips felt melted: tiny beads beneath his thumb. Clock, weather, compass, calculator, maps, all the utility functions he normally summoned by .fingernail pressure . . . all gone. He guessed his implant had been fried with a magnetic pulse. It .t the program of disorientation. <p></p>They weren't as smart as they thought. The room had no sanitary facilities, not so much as a chamber pot, and so far he felt no need to pee. His black suit was clean, if rumpled. It wasn't an ironclad case, but Sigmund guessed he had been snatched from that pedestrian mall no more than a few hours ago. <p></p>Footsteps! They approached along the unseen corridor beyond the out-of- reach door. The door flew open. <p></p>A tall figure, easily two meters tall, stood in the doorway. A tall fringe of hair bobbed on an otherwise bald head: a Belter crest. And did not Hector, mightiest of the Trojans, famously wear a helmet with a plume of horsehair? It all .t with the Trojan Mafia. <p></p>Sigmund blinked in the suddenly bright light, unable to make out details. <p></p>"Good," the Belter said. "I see you're awake. There's someone who wants to speak with you." <p></p>"YOU SEEM UNSURPRISED, Mr. Ausfaller." <p></p>An eerie calm came over Sigmund. "Someone had to put through all the requests for reassignment. Someone had to tolerate one unproductive investigation after another." <p></p>"Your boss," his captor said. <p></p>"Someone had to authorize those transfers. Someone had to accept the department's persistent failures." Sigmund mustered all the irony he could. "Sir." <p></p>"Meaning me." Ben Grimaldi, Undersecretary-General for Inspections, leaned casually against the wall. Body language somehow added, Your suspicions make this easier. <p></p>That was self-justifying nonsense, of course. Grimaldi would not have shown himself had there been any chance Sigmund would be let free. <p></p>Grimaldi broke a lengthening silence. "I need to learn what you know. More importantly, I need to know how." <p></p>Once I reveal that, Sigmund thought, I'm dead. He shifted position, his chains clicking dully. Change the subject. "Why the Trojans?" <p></p>Grimaldi smiled humorlessly. "We prefer Achilles. The Trojans were losers." <p></p>The Trojan Asteroids fell into two groups, those orbiting the L4 Lagrange point, 60 degrees ahead of Jupiter in its orbit, and those orbiting the L5 point, 60 degrees behind. The Greek Camp and the Trojan Camp, as they were sometimes called. Achilles was among the largest asteroids in the Greek Camp. Of course Hector <i>also</i> orbited there, so named before the labeling convention began. . . . <p></p>Sigmund pinched his leg, desperate to unmuddle his thoughts. "How much dope did you give me?" he demanded. <p></p>"Enough." Grimaldi looked pointedly at his wrist implant. "I must be going soon. Your stay here will be much more pleasant if you answer our questions voluntarily." <p></p>More pleasant, perhaps. Also shorter? Did buying time matter? "Why the Trojans?" <p></p>"Why would you think, Ausfaller? They made a generous offer for my assistance. Official scrutiny is bad for their business. <p></p>"You're an odd one, Sigmund, but I admit you're capable. Persistent. I truly wish I thought we could buy you. Sadly, you inherited piles of money. You still chose to work for a pittance at the UN." Grimaldi shook his head. "You live like a monk. You dress like a monk. Why offer you money when you ignore the wealth you already have? It seems too likely you have principles." <p></p>And there it was, the memory Sigmund had struggled for. Money. He tried and failed to blink away the fuzziness. "Perhaps I can pay <i>you</i>." <p></p>A reflexive flash of contempt-and then, more slowly, an expression of low cunning. Grimaldi said, "You'd still have to tell everything you've learned about me and my associates. And every detail about <i>how</i> you learned. It won't do for someone else to discover what you did." <p></p>"Understood." <p></p>"You wouldn't try to trick me, now would you?" Grimaldi asked. <p></p>"Of course not," Sigmund answered. <p></p>Grimaldi smacked his hands together; strangely, that assurance had sufficed. "Stet. There will be no negotiation. One million stars, transferred into the numbered Belter account I will give you. Don't bother to protest. I know you're good for it. When your weekly reports began to show progress, I made it a point to learn about you. Here's the deal, Mr. Ausfaller. You pay. You tell all. Then we let you go." <p></p>He'd never be let go, but Sigmund acted as though he believed. Anyway, the million-and-change he thought Grimaldi could trace was merely the fraction of Sigmund's wealth he intended to be visible-and it wasn't as though there were anyone to leave his money to. At worst, the charade might make his final hours less unpleasant. <p></p>Sigmund raised his arms, clanking on purpose. "For a million stars, I want these off. I want a nicer room. A suite with plumbing would be good." <p></p>"We'll see about that after the funds clear. Until then, maybe a pot." Grimaldi took a sonic stunner and a handheld computer from pockets of his bodysuit. He whispered inaudibly into the handheld, set it on the deck, and then slid it with his shoe tip toward Sigmund. Handheld and foot never came within Sigmund's reach. The sonic stunner was fixed on him. <p></p>"I'm logged into an anonymous account. All other comm functions are locked out. Moments after my funds are received, they'll be shifted elsewhere." Grimaldi laughed. "My colleagues, as I'm sure you know, are skilled in anonymous transfers." <p></p><i>My funds</i>. Sigmund held in his anger. "Funds transfer from Bank of North America." He paused for the voiceprint check. "Account: five . . . four . . . one. . . ." He articulated slowly and distinctly, leaving no chance for misinterpretation. Account number. Subaccount.

She was the first author to be inducted into the Romance Writers of America Hall of Fame. As of 2011, her novels had spent a combined 861 weeks on the <em>New York Times</em> Bestseller List, including 176 weeks in the number-one spot. Over 280 million copies of her books are in print, including 12 million copies sold in 2005 alone.</p>It wasn't going to be an ordinary day. Now that the decision had been made, it would be a long time before things settled down to the merely ordinary again. She could only hope she was doing the right thing.<br><br>In the quiet, animal-scented air of the barn, Abby saddled her horse. Maybe it was wrong to steal this time in the middle of the day when there was still so much to be done, but she needed it. An hour alone, away from the house, away from obligations, seemed like an enormous luxury.<br><br>Abby hesitated, then shook her head and fastened the cinch. If you were going to steal, you might as well go for the luxurious. Because it was something her father might have said, she laughed to herself. Besides, if Mr. Jorgensen really wanted to buy the foal, he'd call back. The books needed balancing and the feed bill was overdue. She could deal with it later. Right now she wanted a fast ride to nowhere.<br><br>Two of the barn cats circled, then settled back into the hay as she led the roan gelding outside. His breath puffed out in a cloud of mist as she double-checked his cinch. "Let's go, Judd." With the ease of long experience, she swung herself into the saddle and headed south.<br><br>There would be no fast ride here, where the snow and mud had mixed itself into a slushy mire. The air was cold and heavy with damp, but she felt a sense of anticipation. Things were changing, and wasn't that all anyone could ask? They kept to a fast walk, with both of them straining for what always seemed just out of reach. Freedom.<br><br>Perhaps agreeing to be interviewed for this book would bring some portion of it. She could only hope. But the doubts she'd lived with ever since the arrangements had been made still hovered. What was right, what was wrong, what were the consequences? She'd have to assume the responsibility, no matter what occurred.<br><br>She rode over the land she loved yet never quite considered her own.<br><br>The snow was melting in the pasture. In another month, she thought, the foals could play on the new grass. She'd plant hay and oats, and this year&#x2014;maybe this year&#x2014;her books would inch over into the black.<br><br>Chuck would never have worried. He'd never thought about tomorrow, only about the next moment. The next car race. She knew why he'd bought the land in rural Virginia. Perhaps she'd always known. But at the time she'd been able to take his gesture of guilt as a gesture of hope. Her ability to find and hold on to thin threads of hope had gotten her through the last eight years.<br><br>Chuck had bought the land, then had spent only a few scattered weeks on it. He'd been too restless to sit and watch the grass grow. Restless, careless and selfish, that was Chuck. She'd known that before she'd married him. Perhaps that was why she'd married him. She couldn't claim he'd ever pretended to be anything else. It was simply that she'd looked and seen what she'd wanted to see. He'd swept into her life like the comet he was and, blinded with fascination, she'd followed.<br><br>The eighteen-year-old Abigail O'Hurley had been stunned and thrilled at being romanced by the dramatic Chuck Rockwell. His name had been front-page news as he'd raced his way through the Grand Prix circuit. His name had been in bold type on the scandal sheets as he'd raced his way through the hearts of women. The young Abigail hadn't read the tabloids.<br><br>He'd spun her into his life in Miami, charmed and dazzled her. He'd offered excitement. Excitement and a freedom from responsibilities. She'd been married before she'd been able to catch her breath.<br><br>Though a light drizzle was falling now, Abby stopped her horse. She didn't mind the rain that dampened her face and jacket. It added another quality she'd needed that morning. Isolation. A coward's way, she knew, but she'd never thought herself brave. What she had done&#x2014;what she would continue to do&#x2014;was survive.<br><br>The land curved gently, patched with snow, misted with a fog that hovered over it. When Judd pawed the ground impatiently, she patted his neck until he was quiet again. It was so beautiful. She'd been to Monte Carlo, to London and Paris and Bonn, but after nearly five years of day-to-day living and dawn-to-dusk working, she still thought this was the most beautiful sight in the world.<br><br>The rain splattered down, promising to make the dirt roads that crisscrossed her land all but unmanageable. If the temperatures dropped that night, the rain would freeze and leave a slick and dangerous sheen of ice over the snow. But it was beautiful. She owed Chuck for this. And for so much more.<br><br>He'd been her husband. Now she was his widow. Before he'd burned himself out, he'd singed her badly, but he'd left her two of the most important things in her life: her sons.<br><br>It was for them she'd finally agreed to let the writer come. She'd dodged offers from publishers for more than four years. That hadn't stopped an unauthorized biography of Chuck Rockwell or the stories that still appeared from time to time in the papers. After months of soul-searching, Abby had finally come to the conclusion that if she worked with a writer, a good writer, she would have some control over the final product. When it was done, her sons would have something of their father.<br><br>Dylan Crosby was a very good writer. Abby knew that was as much a disadvantage as an advantage. He'd poke into areas she was determined to keep off-limits. She wanted him to. When he did, she'd answer in her way, and she'd finally close that chapter of her life.<br><br>She would have to be clever. With a shake of her head, she clucked to her horse and sent him moving again. The trouble was, she'd never been the clever one. Chantel had been that. Her older sister&#x2014;older by two and a half minutes&#x2014;had always been able to plan and manipulate and make things happen.<br><br>Then there was Maddy, her other sister, younger by two minutes and ten seconds. Maddy was the outgoing one, the one who could usually make her own way through sheer drive and will.<br><br>But she was Abby, the middle triplet. The quiet one. The responsible one. The dependable one. Those titles still made her wince.<br><br>Her problem now wasn't a label that had been pinned on her before she could walk. Her problem now was Dylan Crosby, former investigative reporter turned biographer. In his twenties he'd unearthed a Mafia connection that had eventually crumbled one of the largest mob families on the East Coast. Before he'd turned thirty he'd unhinged the career of a senator with an unreported Swiss bank account and aspirations to higher office. Now she had to handle him.<br><br>And she would. After all, he would be on her turf, under her roof. She would feed him information. The secrets she wanted kept secret were locked in her own head and her own heart. She alone had the key.<br><br>If she'd learned nothing else as the middle daughter of a pair of road-roving entertainers, she'd learned how to act. To get what she wanted, all she had to do was give Dylan Crosby one hell of a show.<br><br><i>Never tell the whole truth, girl. Nobody wants to hear it. </i>That's what her father would have said. And that, Abby told herself with a smile, was what she'd keep reminding herself of over the next few months.<br><br>A bit reluctant to leave the open road and the rain, Abby turned her horse and headed back. It was almost time to begin.<br><br>Dylan cursed the rain and reached out the window again to wipe at the windshield with an already-drenched rag. The wiper on his side was working only in spurts. The one on the other side had quit altogether. Icy rain soaked through his coat sleeve as he held the wheel with one hand and cleared his vision with the other. He'd been mad to buy such an old car, classic or not. The '62 Vette looked like a dream and ran like a nightmare.<br><br>It probably hadn't been too smart to drive down from New York in February, either, but he'd wanted the freedom of having his own car&#x2014;such as it was. At least the snow he'd run into in Delaware had turned to rain as he'd driven south. But he cursed the rain again as it pelted through the open window and down his collar.<br><br>It could be worse, he told himself. He couldn't think of precisely how, but it probably could. After all, he was finally going to sink his teeth into a project he'd been trying to make gel for three years. Apparently Abigail O'Hurley Rockwell had decided she'd squeezed the publisher for all she could get.<br><br>A pretty sharp lady, he figured. She'd snagged one of the hottest and wealthiest race car drivers on the circuit. And she'd hardly been more than a kid. Before she'd reached nineteen she'd been wearing mink and diamonds and rolling dice in places like Monte Carlo. It was never much strain to spend someone else's money. His ex-wife had shown him that in a mercifully brief eighteen-month union.<br><br>Women were, after all, born with guile. They were fashioned to masquerade as helpless, vulnerable creatures. Until they had their hooks in you. To shake free, you had to bleed a little. Then if you were smart, you took a hard look at the scars from time to time to remind yourself how life really worked.<br><br>Dylan struggled with the map beside him, held it in front while steering with his elbows, then swore again. Yes, that had been his turn. He'd just missed it. With a quick glance up and down the stretch of rain-fogged road, he spun into a U-turn. The wipers might be pitiful, but the Vette knew how to move.<br><br>He couldn't imagine the Chuck Rockwell he'd followed and admired choosing to settle in the backwoods of Virginia. Maybe the little woman had talked him into buying it as some sort of hideaway. She'd certainly been hibernating there for the past few years.<br><br>Just what kind of woman was she? In order to write a thorough biography of the man, he had to understand the woman. She'd stuck with Rockwell like glue for nearly the first full year on the circuit, then she'd all but disappeared. Maybe the smell of gas and smoking tires had annoyed her. She hadn't been in the stands for her husband's victories or his defeats. Most importantly, she hadn't been there when he'd run his last race. The one that had killed him. From the information Dylan had, she'd finally shown up at the funeral three days later but had hardly spoken a word. She hadn't shed a tear.<br><br>She'd married a gold mine and turned a blind eye to his infidelities. Money was the only answer. Now, as his widow, she was in the position of never having to lift a finger. Not bad for a former singer who'd never made it past hotel lounges and second-rate clubs.<br><br>He had to slow the Vette to a crawl to make it down the slushy, rut-filled lane marked by a battered mailbox with Rockwell painted on the side.<br><br>Obviously she didn't believe in spending much money on maintenance. Dylan wiped his window again and set his teeth against each jarring bump. When he heard his muffler scrape, he stopped cursing the rain and started cursing Abigail. The way he saw it, she had a closetful of silk and fur but wouldn't shell out for minimal road repair.<br><br>When he saw the house, he perked up a bit. It wasn't the imposing, oppressive plantation house he'd been expecting. It was charming and homey, right down to the rocker on the front porch. The shutters on the windows were painted Colonial blue, providing a nice contrast to the white frame. A deck with a double railing skirted the second floor. Though he could see the house needed a new paint job, it didn't look run-down, just lived-in. There was smoke trailing up from the chimney and a bike with training wheels leaning on its kick-stand under the overhang of the roof. The sound of a dog's deep-throated barking completed the scene.<br><br>He'd often thought of finding a place just like this for himself. A place away from crowds and noise where he could concentrate on writing. It reminded him of the home he'd had as a child, where security had gone hand in hand with hard work.<br><br>When his muffler scraped the road again, he was no longer charmed. Dylan pulled up behind a pickup truck and a compact station wagon and shut off his engine. Dropping his rag on the floor mat, he rolled up his window and had started to open the door when a mass of wet fur leaped on it.<br><br>The dog was enormous. Maybe it had meant to give a friendly greeting, but in its current bedraggled state, the animal didn't look too pleasant. As Dylan gauged its size against that of a small hippo the dog scraped two muddy paws down his window and barked.<br><br>"Sigmund!"<br><br>Both Dylan and the dog looked toward the house, where a woman stood near the porch steps. So this was Abigail, he mused. He'd seen enough pictures of her over the years to recognize her instantly. The fresh-faced ingenue in the pits at Rockwell's races. The stunning socialite in London and Chicago. The cool, composed widow by her husband's grave. Yet she wasn't precisely what he'd expected.<br><br>Her hair, a honey blond, fell across her forehead in wispy bangs and skimmed her shoulders. She looked very slender, and very comfortable in jeans and boots and a bulky sweater that bagged at her hips. Her face was pale and delicate through the rain. He couldn't see the color of her eyes, but he could see her mouth, full and un-painted as she called to the dog again.<br><br>"Sigmund, get down now."<br><br>The dog let out a last halfhearted bark and obeyed. Cautious, Dylan opened the door and stepped out. "Mrs. Rockwell?"<br><br>"Yes. Sorry about the dog. He doesn't bite. Very often."<br><br>"There's good news," Dylan muttered, and popped his trunk.<br><br>As he pulled out his bags, Abby stood where she was while her nerves tightened. He was a stranger, and she was letting him into her home, into her life. Maybe she should stop it now, right now before he'd taken another step.<br><br>Then he turned, bags in hand, and looked at her. Rain streamed from his hair. It was dark, darker now wet and plastered around his face. Not a kind face, she thought immediately as she rubbed her palms on her thighs. There was too much living in it, too much knowledge, for kindness. A woman had to be crazy to let a man like that into her life. Then she saw that his clothes were drenched and his shoes already coated with mud.</p><h2>Flight Of The Quetzalcoatlus (Dinosaur Cove #4)</h2><p>Two friends discover a secret entrance to a prehistoric world.

Surviving sandstorms, locusts and malaria, she documents the bold geometric and symbolic wall paintings made by women in remote West African villages. These women transform objects from their daily world--a fish net, a cooking pot, a weaving, a calabash--into rippling patterns laden with cosmic significance. Made with natural pigments from plants or clay, these pictures often perish in the rainy season. Creeping urbanization is also taking its toll on the villages, whose mud compounds, houses, clothing, body painting and pottery Courtney-Clarke documents as well. This strong, moving photoessay is equally valuable as an investigation of a dwindling way of life and as a permanent record of a seldom-seen vernacular art form. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.This book is by no means a scholarly treatise but rather a beautiful pictorial survey of many of the traditions of architectural decoration created by women in various regions of West Africa. Courtney-Clarke, a journalist-photographer who previously wrote the similar Ndebele: The Art of an African Tribe ( LJ 8/86), provides an introduction consisting of commentary on the problems of locating and photographing the murals and their artists, as well as a brief discussion preceding each group of photos. As a record of an ephemeral art that is being abandoned in many areas, this book is strongly recommended for public and academic libraries.<br><i>- Eugene C.

He covers the business of real estate and the history of apartment-dwelling well, and the mixture of anthropological observation of the super-rich and sheer voyeurism makes the book compulsively listenable. While Gaines's subtle New York accent does fit the material, occasional mispronounced or dropped words and hard-to-endure attempts at a Southern accent are distracting.

This quest for harmony between the natural and the manmade has yielded some of the most spectacular gardens ever created. <p><i>The Modern Garden</i> is the first fully illustrated overview of the great gardens of the 20th century. It portrays hundreds of gardens, from the works of Geoffrey Jellicoe to Roberto Burle Marx, Russell Page to Dan Kiley, Isamu Noguchi to Richard Haag, created throughout the century and around the world. Twelve "masterwork" gardens are explored in special detail; photographed in spectacular color and supplemented by never-before-seen historical images, they come alive in this beautifully produced volume. Masterwork gardens featured: Guevrekian's Hyeres, France; Ludwig Gerns garden, Germany; Geoffrey Jellicoe garden, London; Fletcher Steele, Naumkeag, Massachusetts; Dan Kiley, Miller House, Indiana; Walter Gropius at home, Massachusetts; Mien Ruys, Dedmsvaart Garden, the Netherlands; Roberto Burle Marx, Brazil; Pietro Porcinai, Villa Il rosetto, Italy; Russell Page, Villa Silvio Pellico, Italy; Arne Jacobsen,St. Catherine's College England; Isamu Noguchi, the California Scenario.</p></p><p>Jane Brown has written books on garden design and 20th century culture, including Gardens of a Golden Afternoon, The Pursuit of Paradise, and The English Garden.The image of the garden is ever changing, reflecting the styles, needs, and technology of the times. These three books are fine examples of the current approach to the planning, development, and realization of gardens that utilize human-made materials and innovative spatial design to create nontraditional settings. Cooper's The New Tech Garden employs materials and methods quite unlike anything in the past, e.g., metals; plastics; glass, recycled or new; synthetic fabrics; and solar panels. Examining various sites, both public and private, throughout the world, Cooper provides a glimpse into radical designs for unconventional spaces that result in instant, mobile, and architectural gardens. What is most interesting about these gardens, which the book effectively illustrates, is the feeling of serenity and space afforded by even the most unconventional designs. In The Modern Garden, English cultural historian Brown offers a more conventional work, tracing landscape design and its most important figures over the past century. A wide geographic range of gardens is featured, along with 11 "masterworks," specific sections examining in detail the work of one important artist, from Gropius and Barrag n to Kiley and Burle Marx. Political, cultural, and ecological thinking, which shaped modern garden movement in Europe in the 1920s and the United States in the 1930s, is well explored in the lucid text, which is accompanied by excellent photographs and extensive plans. Finally, Keeney's On the Nature of Things offers an image of landscape architecture from the studios of American professionals. Taking a much more theoretical approach than the other two works, this book deals with a sense of the community and its interaction with nature in the many public spaces addressed. Many of the sites, in the United States and across the world, are new or still in the planning stage, and the philosophy behind their construction is the major component of this work. The final decision as to the universality of the designs and their eventual utilization remains to be seen, but the author does present an interesting aspect of the unique discipline of the architecture of our landscape, external and internal.

After appearing in several editions beginning in 1536, Calvin&#39;s &#39;Institutes&#39; was finally published in this authoritative 1559 edition.John Calvin (1509-1564) was a French Protestant theologian during the Protestant Reformation and was a central developer of the system of Christian theology called Calvinism or Reformed theology. In Geneva he rejected the authority of the Pope, established a new scheme of civic and church governance, and created a central hub from which Reformed theology was propagated. He is renowned for his teachings and writings.</p><h2>Captivate: The Science of Succeeding with People [Paperback] [Jun 28, 2018] Van Edwards, Vanessa</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

Such was the degree of fame and wealth that he acquired that he became a legend within his own lifetime. In the centuries since his death his work has been almost universally admired, and he has been cast as the prototype for artistic genius.</p><p>The books in the Art and Ideas series, which will cover everything from Fra Angelico to Frida Kahlo, are supremely pleasurable to read. In this volume, for example, Anthony Hughes writes dryly of a Michelangelo sculpture of Christ, which was tinkered with and damaged during installation in March 1521: &#34;Since then, more tampering has taken place.... From the late sixteenth century, Christ&#39;s genitalia were hidden beneath a bronze loincloth, although that did not prevent a zealous Dominican from trying to remove the penis.&#34; Written by scholarly experts who know how to turn a phrase and focus a gaze, the books are filled with hundreds of crisp, color reproductions that give purely visual pleasure and information. Their handy size, 6 1/4 by 8 1/2 inches, makes them easy to carry in a briefcase or backpack, and the text is printed in an easy-to-read typeface, with generous spacing. Even the time lines, biographies, and glossaries in the back are inviting to the eye. There will eventually be more than 100 volumes in the series, which is comparable to Thames and Hudson&#39;s World of Art series.Anthony Hughes was formerly Senior Lecturer in the History of Art at the University of Leeds. He is Co-Editor of Sculpture and Its Reproductions.</p><h2>The Story of the Champions of the Round Table (Dover Children&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Written two years after <i>The Story of King Arthur and His Knights</i>, this Howard Pyle book returns to Arthur's court and presents the adventure-filled stories of three worthy, noble, excellent knights-champions &#x2014; Sir Launcelot, Sir Tristram, and Sir Percival.<br>The stories of these three knights are among the most colorful and enduring in the vast body of Arthurian legend. The love-story of Tristram and the beautiful Isoult, of King Mark and of magic potions; the wondrous legend of Launcelot's emergence from the castle of the Round Table; Percival's championship of the Lady Yvette and his adventures at the Castle of Beaurepaire &#x2014; these are all retold in Pyle's inimitable style, capturing perfectly the tone and spirit of ancient romance. Just as successful are Pyle's illustrations. 50 drawings, 31 of them full-page size, help make this one of the most memorable adventure books ever written for young readers.<br>These stories have inspired numerous film adaptations, including the 2017 release <i>Knights of the Roundtable: King Arthur</i>, directed by Guy Ritchie and starring Charlie Hunnam, Jude Law, Eric Bana, Djimon Hounsou, and Annabelle Wallis.</p><p>I am not the author but merely a private publisher. Howard Pyle was born in 1853 and was well known as an illustrator, training men such as N.C. Wyeth. My wife and I wanted to reproduce some of his works to be enjoyed by a younger generation and have entirely re-typeset all the books we published as well as cleaned up some of the images to make them suitable for reprinting. This was a labor of love and we hope you enjoy reading the books as much as we did.<br><br>We have reprinted the four books about King Arthur and his knights as well as The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood, all in a blue hardbound format.The stories and drawings of Howard Pyle (1853-1911) epitomize &#34;the golden age of American illustration.&#34; A priceless contribution to American children&#39;s literature, Pyle&#39;s work set a standard of excellence, with tales and images remarkable for their engaging simplicity and penetrating realism.</p><h2>OUR ORIGINS 4E PA TEXT Paperback</h2><p>See similar book below as this is just a variant.</p><p>Clark Spencer Larsen heads the Department of Anthropology at Ohio State University, Columbus.

Now he uses what he&#x2019;s learned from a life insidea subculture few will ever know to create his no-holds-barred first novel, giving readers a taste of thecamaraderie, the pain, and the thrills of what it&#x2019;s like to live life on two wheels.</p><p>Everett John "Patch" Kinkade just wants to be left alone. The former president of the Infidelz, the most powerful motorcycle club in California, Patch has grown weary of the responsibilities and burdens that come with the mantle of leadership. He leaves California for Arizona, determined to start a new life and to put a few hundred miles between him and the tragedy that tore his family apart.</p><p>But it isn't long before a new crisis pulls Patch back to his old stomping grounds. Tension between the Infidelz and a rival club, the 2Wheelers, erupts one night in a lethal free-for-all, littering a casino with the corpses of club members and ordinary citizens alike. The newspapers call it a war, and Patch knows he must return to help the club, either by making peace or by charging into battle.Now it's not just his life at stake, but the lives of the rest of the Infidelz as well, and Patch would fight the Grim Reaper himself to protect his brothers. Prepared to destroy any man who crosses his path, even if it means confronting the demons from his past, Patch gases up his Harley, sharpens his blade, and heads out on the highway for what could be his final ride.</p></p><p><p>Ralph "Sonny" Barger is the author of <em>Hell's Angel: The Life and Times of Sonny Barger and the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club</em>. A master mechanic who has owned and operated his own bike shops, he currently lives in Arizona, where he rides every day.</p>Legendary Hell's Angel Barger (Hell's Angel; Ridin' High, Livin' Free) teams once again with co-authors Keith and Kent Zimmerman on this debut novel of motorcycles and murder. Patch Kinkade, ex-president of the Oakland, Calif., chapter of the Infidelz motorcycle club, the toughest MC in the West, has relocated to Arizona in the wake of a busted marriage. But he finds that ties to home and past are not easily severed. The Infidelz have a serious dust-up in a bar with three other clubs-the 2Wheelers, Soul Sacrifice and the Gun Runners ("Fists flew everywhere. Broken ribs. Broken arms. Broken bottles. Broken teeth. Broken pride)"-and after it's over, a new member of the Infidelz lies dead in the parking lot, his murder seemingly unrelated to the fight inside. Ahab, the president of the Oakland chapter, hunts down Patch and asks him to investigate. Soon enough, the reluctant Patch is back in Oakland, facing renegade FBI agents and unexpected treachery and deceit. The authors have an un-ironic, breezy style: "Patch wore no businessman's haircut. The wind was his stylist." Despite colorful nicknames (girls named Blondie and LiLac, dudes called Nine Inch, 12-12 and Eight Ball), thin characterization leads to reader confusion, and degenerate behavior makes it difficult to cheer for the novel's putative good guys. The mystery falls flat, but there's plenty of sex, violence and tricked-out bikes in this "gasoline and adrenaline" ride. Barger's fans should love it.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Tales from Silver Lands</h2><p>Nineteen myths and folk stories from Central and South America are illustrated with striking woodcuts.</p><p>English author Charles J.

Stott (1921-2011) has been known worldwide as a preacher, evangelist and communicator of Scripture. For many years he served as rector of All Souls Church in London, where he carried out an effective urban pastoral ministry. A leader among evangelicals in Britain, the United States and around the world, Stott was a principal framer of the landmark Lausanne Covenant (1974). His many books have sold millions of copies around the world and in dozens of languages. Stott�s best-known work, <em>Basic Christianity,</em> has sold two million copies and has been translated into more than 60 languages. Other titles include <em>The Cross of Christ, Understanding the Bible, The Contemporary Christian, Evangelical Truth, Issues Facing Christians Today, The Incomparable Christ, Why I Am a Christian</em> and <em>Through the Bible Through the Year,</em> a daily devotional. He has also written eight volumes in <em>The Bible Speaks Today</em> series of New Testament expositions. Whether in the West or in the Two-Thirds World, a hallmark of Stott's ministry has been expository preaching that addresses the hearts and minds of contemporary men and women. Stott was honored by <em>Time</em> magazine in 2005 as one of the "100 Most Influential People in the World" and was named in the Queen�s New Years Honours list as Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1969, Stott founded the Langham Trust to fund scholarships for young evangelical leaders from the Majority World. He then founded the Evangelical Literature Trust, which provided books for students, pastors and theological libraries in the Majority World. These two trusts continued as independent charities until 2001, when they were joined as a single charity: the Langham Partnership. Langham's vision continues today to see churches in the Majority World equipped for mission and growing to maturity in Christ through nurturing national movements for biblical preaching, fostering the creation and distribution of evangelical literature, and enhancing evangelical theological education.</p><h2>Selected Stories</h2><p>Nobel prize winner.</p><p>"Too many things," a creative writing instructor tells the narrator of "Differently." "Too many things going on at the same time; also too many people. Think, he told her. What is the important thing? What do you want us to pay attention to? Think." What does Alice Munro want us to pay attention to in her <i>Selected Stories</i>? Everything, really, and so her narratives loop back on themselves, jump decades backward and forward in time, introduce characters who later drop out of the action, and generally break every rule in the short-story-writing book. In "Carried Away," for instance, a dead character makes a sudden, inexplicable appearance in what is otherwise the thoroughly naturalistic account of a librarian's disappointment with love. "The Albanian Virgin" is two stories in one: the first--the fanciful tale of Ghegs kidnapping a young Canadian woman--is told within the second, about a bookstore owner who has lost her own bearings after a divorce. There are stories that begin with their endings, and several more that end with beginnings; others are told from three or four different angles, each with varying degrees of reliability. Taken together, they form an intricate web of relationships and connections, falsehood and anecdote, a kind of fictional palimpsest laid over the faint traces of plot.<p> And yet Munro trusts her readers; she believes that we will pay attention to all these things and more. She aims to create the illusion that everything in her fiction has been left in, and it is this very capaciousness that sets her work apart, making possible the keen psychological insight of her stories about marriage as well as the cool violence of "Vandals" or "Fits." Hers is an unusual sort of realism, technically innovative and amenable--especially in the later work--to loose ends. (It also possesses a quick, flinty wit: "This was the first time I understood how God could become a real opponent, not just some kind of nuisance or large decoration," says the narrator of "The Progress of Love.") To call Munro the Canadian Chekhov is by now a commonplace--and yet she may have done more for the short fiction form than any writer since. These are stories that will be read, savored, and admired hundreds of years from now. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>Spanning almost thirty years and settings that range from big cities to small towns and farmsteads of rural Canada, this magnificent collection brings together twenty-eight stories by a writer of unparalleled wit, generosity, and emotional power. In her <b>Selected Stories</b>, Alice Munro makes lives that seem small unfold until they are revealed to be as spacious as prairies and locates the moments of love and betrayal, desire and forgiveness, that change those lives forever. To read these stories--about a traveling salesman and his children on an impromptu journey; an abandoned woman choosing between seduction and solitude--is to succumb to the spell of a writer who enchants her readers utterly even as she restores them to their truest selves.</p><h2>The Price of Illusion: A Memoir</h2><p>From Joan Juliet Buck, former editor-in-chief of Paris <i>Vogue</i> comes her dazzling, compulsively readable memoir: a fabulous account of four decades spent in the creative heart of London, New York, Los Angeles, and Paris, chronicling her quest to discover the difference between glitter and gold, illusion and reality, and what looks like happiness from the thing itself.<br><br>Born into a world of make-believe as the daughter of a larger-than-life film producer, Joan Juliet Buck&#x2019;s childhood was a whirlwind of famous faces, ever-changing home addresses, and a fascination with the shiny surfaces of things. When Joan became the first and only American woman ever to fill Paris <i>Vogue</i>'s coveted position of Editor in Chief, a &#x201c;figurehead in the cult of fashion and beauty,&#x201d; she had the means to recreate for her aging father, now a widower, the life he&#x2019;d enjoyed during his high-flying years, a splendid illusion of glamorous excess that could not be sustained indefinitely.<br> <br> Joan&#x2019;s memoir tells the story of a life lived in the best places at the most interesting times: London and New York in the swinging 1960s, Rome and Milan in the dangerous 1970s, Paris in the heady 1980s and 1990s. But when her fantasy life at <i>Vogue </i>came to an end, she had to find out who she was after all those years of make-believe. She chronicles this journey in beautiful and at times heartbreaking prose, taking the reader through the wild parties and the fashion, the celebrities and creative geniuses as well as love, loss, and the loneliness of getting everything you thought you wanted and finding it&#x2019;s not what you&#x2019;d imagined. While Joan&#x2019;s story is unique, her journey toward self-discovery is refreshing and universal.</p><p>Joan Juliet Buck is an American novelist, critic, essayist, and editor.

I told myself it wasn&#x2019;t personal.<br> <br>The lightning and the rain created traffic jams through Milan that made me late to meet Jonathan Newhouse at Caff� Cova, where I&#x2019;d been summoned for a talk before the first fashion show. When I arrived, I apologized for the weather.<br> <br>He sat on a corner banquette beneath a display of porcelain, wearing new glasses that made him look like Rodchenko.<br> <br>The teacups shone in the glass case behind him; the brass fittings on the mahogany glowed around us in the muted clatter of high heels and waiters&#x2019; shoes and teaspoons in china cups and distant bursts of steam nozzles foaming the cappuccinos in the front room. I could feel the tight armholes of my narrow tweed coat, the tug of the pink velvet seat against the crepe of my dress, my platform shoes tight over my toes. My laptop was at my feet in a Gucci case designed for me, next to my Prada bag. New look for the new season, every label in place.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want you to take a sabbatical, starting today,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;On the first day of the European collections?

He pushed a piece of paper at me with one word on it, the name of the place where he wanted me to go. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just two months, then you&#x2019;ll come back. I&#x2019;m doing this because I&#x2019;m your friend.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Either you&#x2019;re my friend, or you&#x2019;re setting me up,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I choose to believe you are my friend.&#x201d;<br> <br>And having demonstrated to myself how gallant I could be, I decided to proceed to the next item on the typed list my assistant had pasted in my datebook. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m late for Prada,&#x201d; I said, and before he could stop me I rose and carried my two bags through the steam and crowd of the front room, out into the rain to the waiting car, and on to the Prada show, where I stared at the shoes on the feet of the editors across the runway, and then at the shoes on the feet of the models on the runway, until it hit me that my opinion of the shoes, the dresses, the models, the hair, had entirely ceased to matter. When the show was over, the front-row editors headed backstage to congratulate Miuccia Prada, and I walked very slowly the other way, out onto the street.<br> <br>Back in my hotel room, I stared at the bed, uncertain what to do next. Beautifully wrapped packages from fashion houses were piled everywhere. I knew the same gifts were in the rooms of every editor in chief in every hotel in Milan: small leather goods with logos, the new handbag, the new fragrance, the new scarf and tassel. Garment bags lay across the sofa, heavy with the fall clothes I&#x2019;d ordered from Missoni and Jil Sander six months earlier. Clothes for a life I no longer had. He&#x2019;d said I would come back, but I knew that wasn&#x2019;t true.<br> <br>I looked at the name of the place where I was supposed to go. It didn&#x2019;t occur to me to call my lawyer.<br> <br>No talking to the press, no talking to anyone, no noise, no movement. He wanted me off the planet, invisible. I couldn&#x2019;t stay at home; my apartment in Paris was in the center of a knot of fashion streets patrolled by attach�s de presse and luxury-goods executives. I&#x2019;d always thought that in a crisis I&#x2019;d retreat to a friend&#x2019;s ranch in central California, but we were in one of our periodic frosts and hadn&#x2019;t spoken for over a year. There were others in America who&#x2019;d welcome me; I could hide in their big houses by the sea as fall became winter, but there would be weekends and weekend guests and gossip, and I had been ordered to vanish.<br> <br>My entire life had been one easy exile after another, but I&#x2019;d lived in too many places to belong anywhere. I had nowhere to go. I looked again at the slip of paper Jonathan had given me.

A warehouse holding copies of Gadsby burned shortly after the book was printed, destroying most copies of the ill-fated novel. The book was never reviewed and only kept alive by the efforts of a few avant-garde intellos and assorted connoisseurs of the odd, weird and zany. But by word-of-mouth it has become an underground cult classic. The book&#39;s scarcity and oddness has in the past seen copies priced at $4,000 by book dealers. Over time, this peculiar masterpiece has had many curious readers open to this interestingly unusual reading experience.</p><p>Ernest Vincent Wright (1873?-1939) was an American author. His most famous work is Gadsby, &#34;A Story of Over 50,000 Words&#34;, which, except for the introduction and a note at the end, did not use the letter e. Every word was properly spelled and all narration was grammatically correct.

Settled in seven provinces in a corner of France and Spain i n a land that is marked on no maps except their own, separated by the daunting Pyrenees Mountains, the Basques are a nation without a countr y with an ancient and dramatic story that</p><p>The buzz about the Guggenheim Bilbao aside, the Basques seldom get good press--from the 12th-century <i>Codex of Calixtus</i> ("A Basque or Navarrese would do in a French man for a copper coin") to current news items about ETA, the Basque nationalist group. Mark Kurlansky, author of <i>Cod</i>, sets out to change all that in <i>The Basque History of the World</i>.<p> "The singular remarkable fact about the Basques is that they still exist," Kurlansky asserts. Without a defined country (other than Euskadi, otherwise known as "Basqueland"), with no known related ethnic groups, the Basques are an anomaly in Europe. What unites the Basques, above all, is their language--Euskera. According to ETA, "Euskera is the quintessence of Euskadi. So long as Euskera is alive, Euskadi will live." To help provide a complete picture of the Basques, Kurlansky looks at their political, economic, social, and even culinary history, from the valiant Basque underground in World War II to medieval whalers to modern makers of the <i>g�teau Basque</i>. The most affecting chapter focuses on Guernica, a small market town bombed by German planes for over three hours on April 26, 1937, and uses interviews with survivors to illustrate the horror of the attack.</p><p> Kurlansky is clearly enamored of the Basques, which leads him to see them in a uniformly positive light. That rosy outlook aside, <i>The Basque History of the World</i> is an excellent introduction to these romantic people. <i>Are</i> they the original Europeans? Kurlansky doesn't weigh in on the issue, preferring instead to honor the Basque request <i>Garean gareana legez</i>--let us be what we are. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>"They are a mythical people, almost an imagined people," writes Mark Kurlansky. Settled in a corner of France and Spain in a land marked on no maps except their own, the Basques are a nation without a country, whose ancient and dramatic story illuminates Europe's own saga. <br> <br>Where did they come from? Signs of their civilization exist well before the arrival of the Romans in 218 B.C., and their culture appears to predate all others in Europe. Their mysterious and forbidden tongue, Euskera, is related to no other language on Earth. The Basques have stubbornly defended their unique culture against the Celts, the Romans, the Visigoths and Moors, the kings of Spain and France, Napoleon, Franco, the modern Spanish state, and the European Union. <br> <br>Yet as much as their origins are obscure, the Basques' contributions to world history have been clear and remarkable. Early explorers, they made fortunes whaling before the year 1000 and became the premier cod fishermen in Europe after discovering Canada's Grand Banks. Juan Sebastian de Elcano, a Basque, was the first man to circumnavigate the globe in 1522.

In this urgent and revelatory excavation of our Information Age, leading technology thinker Adam Greenfield forces us to reconsider our relationship with the networked objects, services and spaces that define us. It is time to re-evaluate the Silicon Valley consensus determining the future.<br><br> We already depend on the smartphone to navigate every aspect of our existence. We&#x2019;re told that innovations&#x2014;from augmented-reality interfaces and virtual assistants to autonomous delivery drones and self-driving cars&#x2014;will make life easier, more convenient and more productive. 3D printing promises unprecedented control over the form and distribution of matter, while the blockchain stands to revolutionize everything from the recording and exchange of value to the way we organize the mundane realities of the day to day. And, all the while, fiendishly complex algorithms are operating quietly in the background, reshaping the economy, transforming the fundamental terms of our politics and even redefining what it means to be human.<br><br> Having successfully colonized everyday life, these radical technologies are now conditioning the choices available to us in the years to come. How do they work? What challenges do they present to us, as individuals and societies? Who benefits from their adoption?

The dark glass dome of the Grand Palais loomed ahead over the bare-branched trees. To his right, the circular nineteenth-century Th��tre Marigny.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>Non, non</i>, if I don&#x2019;t walk home I&#x2019;ll regret it tomorrow.&#x201d; He waved off his two drunken friends, men he&#x2019;d known since his childhood in the village, as they laughingly fell into a taxi. Course had followed course; remembering the caviar-dotted lobster in a rich velout� sauce topped off by Courvoisier brandy, he rubbed his stomach again as he waved goodnight to the departing taxi. His belly was taut with discomfort; he needed to stretch it out before bed. Besides, he always enjoyed the walk home to his place on Place Fran�ois Premier. Even now, after all these years, pride swelled in his chest that he had secured himself an address in <i>le triangle d&#x2019;or</i>, the golden triangle, the most exclusive quartier in Paris. The thrill of living among the mansions and <i>h�tels de luxe </i>between avenues Montaigne, George V, and the Champs-�lys�es never got old to him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looped his silk scarf tight, took a deep breath of the piercing chill November night. Belched. The born farmer in him sensed tonight would bring frost&#x2014;a crinkled frost that would melt on the grey cobbles like tears. In the village, it would have been a hoarfrost blanketing the earth like lace.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked over his shoulder&#x2014;force of habit&#x2014;with vigilance that hadn&#x2019;t diminished in forty years. They were always so careful, so scrupulous about the details, took precautions&#x2014;yet Bruno&#x2019;s murder had scared them all. Made them wonder at the implications. Could it be . . . ? But a month passed and nothing. Were they safe? <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not totally safe, not until the final trust document was rubber-stamped tomorrow. But that was only a formality. Nothing would go wrong this late in the game. He knew that&#x2014;they all did.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet why had he woken up shouting in his sleep last night? Why did Philbert&#x2019;s dentures grind so at dinner, and why did Alain drink a whole bottle of wine himself? <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brown leaves gusted against his ankles. On his right a blurred Arc de Triomphe glowed like a painting on a postage stamp farther down the Champs-�lys�es. He kept a brisk pace, got his blood flowing, warmed up. He was fit as a fiddle, his doctor said, his heart like that of a man twenty years younger. A couple passed, huddling together in the cold.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Walking under the barren trees by the Grand Palais, he became aware of footsteps behind him. The footsteps stopped when he did. But as he turned at the intersection in front of the zebra crossing, he saw no one. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nerves. The light turned green. He crossed. Midway down the next block he heard the footsteps again. Turned.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s there?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only a dark hedgerow, shadows cast from trees. Unease prickled the hairs on his neck. He walked faster now, looking for a taxi. Silly, he lived two blocks away, but he never ignored a feeling like this. Each taxi passed with a red light crowning the roof: occupied.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stupid&#x2014;why hadn&#x2019;t he taken the taxi with the others? Kept to their protocol of precautions? His meal, rich in cream, sat in his stomach like a dead weight.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time he heard the footsteps, he turned and saw no one.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paranoid, or was he losing his mind? Or was the brandy heightening sensations and dulling his reflexes?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a taxi with a green light slowed. He waved it down. Thank God.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>Merci</i>,&#x201d; he said, shutting the taxi&#x2019;s door, breathing heavily.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m only supposed to stop at the taxi stand, monsieur.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll make it worth your while in appreciation.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave the address.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s only two blocks from here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Consider your fare doubled, monsieur.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The taxi pulled away from the curb. He asked the driver to close his window.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the driver ignored him. And turned toward the river. Not the way home at all.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ahead, streetlamps rimmed the quai, their globes of light reflecting yellow shimmers on the moving Seine. His heavy insides curdled.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going the wrong way.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The taxi accelerated, throwing him against the back of the seat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Stop.&#x201d; He tried the handle. Locked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afraid now, he pounded the plastic partition and tried reaching for the driver&#x2019;s shoulder. The wheels rumbled down a cobblestoned ramp.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Let me out.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn&#x2019;t even realize where they were until the taxi stopped. The taxi had lurched to a halt below the Pont des Invalides, nestled in the shadow of its arch support. Mist floated over the Seine, the gurgling water swollen by early November rain.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then the door opened and before he could defend himself, his arms were pulled behind him. &#x201c;Take my money, just take what you want.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You know what&#x2019;s going to happen, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; said a voice.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He gasped. &#x201c;Please, let me go.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you remember the river?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Panic flooded him. &#x201c;<i>Non, non</i>. You must understand&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t supposed to happen . . . We can make it right.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Liar. Payback time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A rag was stuffed into his screaming mouth. His bile rose and all the rich food lodged in his gullet, choking him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You remember, don&#x2019;t you? It&#x2019;s your turn now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was shoved to the edge of the quai and down into a squat. Through his blinding terror he saw one of his shoes fall into the water below. The lapping waves from a receding barge and the faint rhythm of faraway car horns masked his cry of pain. Even the lit globes of the sodium lamps faded into the mist on the cloud-blanketed night. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How does it feel?&#x201d; a voice hissed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he couldn&#x2019;t answer as the sour-tasting gag tightened across his mouth. His tied hands gripped and flailed. He couldn&#x2019;t breathe.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn&#x2019;t supposed to happen that way.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shot to the back of his head was muffled by the plastic Vichy bottle used as a silencer and the rumble of the traffic overhead.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <b><i>Paris � November 10, 1989 � Friday Afternoon</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> Aim�e Leduc gazed in horror at the mess in her test tube in the <i>�cole de m�decine </i>lab. Her experiment ruined. Again.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She held the tube to her nose and sniffed. Bleach. Someone had sabotaged her work.

His lectures had a strange but appealing energy. Now he asked, &#x201c;A problem, Mademoiselle Leduc?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Someone poured bleach in my test tube . . .&#x201d; <i>Merde</i>. She didn&#x2019;t want him to think she was the type to whine.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Fabre shook his head. &#x201c;No other students had this issue. Do you expect special treatment? Instead of blaming your errors on others, check your notes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But Dr. Fabre, you can smell it . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So you say, Mademoiselle Leduc. But if it means so much, you should have watched your work more carefully. Perhaps slept here. I did in my premed days.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No sympathy here. They wanted to be doctors and help people&#x2014;why not start with themselves?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She could cope with grueling exams, reports, and all-night studying. But this? She bit her lip, determined not to cry. &#x201c;Professor, would you please let me redo the experiment? I&#x2019;ll have the results by tomorrow morning.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got four classes to grade and my schedule&#x2019;s full. It&#x2019;s not fair to the others, mademoiselle.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or to her, but it seemed that didn&#x2019;t matter.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Let me warn you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We expect the best. Despite the promise you&#x2019;ve shown, you&#x2019;re a candidate for the suspension list. Consider this a formal warning.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her heart dropped. &#x201c;There must be a mistake.&#x201d; She riffled through her bag and pulled out her notebook, where she kept duplicates of her assignments and grades. The same notebook with the surveillance case notes she&#x2019;d been transcribing for her father. &#x201c;Sir, I scored in the top ten percentile, and I turned in all my assignments.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Fabre shook his head. &#x201c;As so have many others. I can&#x2019;t make exceptions.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She managed a nod before she humiliated herself further, and to refrain from kicking the door as he exited.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;She rolled up her lab coat sleeves and cleaned the lab in the coffee-colored light of the dank November afternoon. It was her turn to be the first-year grunt. At the faucet she scrubbed her hands with carbolic soap, trying to figure out what to do. The formaldehyde smell permeated everything. Her shoes, her clothes. She couldn&#x2019;t even shampoo the smell out of her hair at night. Another thing she&#x2019;d chalked up to life in med school.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serge came in, handed her a paper towel, then leaned against the counter where the surgical instruments dried.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;First year&#x2019;s the toughest. You&#x2019;ll get over it. Everyone does, Aim�e.&#x201d; Serge had the beginnings of a beard, thick black hair and myopic eyes behind black-frame glasses. &#x201c;I was a <i>carabin</i>, too.&#x201d; A stupid archaic term still used for med students, because their lab uniforms resembled those of <i>les carabines</i>, riflemen in Napol�on&#x2019;s army.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I expected a grind, but backstabbing?&#x201d; She wanted to spit. &#x201c;You heard Dr. Fabre. I&#x2019;m going to fail.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Pah, you&#x2019;ll make it. It&#x2019;s all about the exam, no matter what he says. You work hard,&#x201d; Serge said. &#x201c;Be patient.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patient, her? It was all she could do to focus. From day one, the competitiveness, that feeling of never measuring up, had dogged her. Every morning she told herself she could do it&#x2014;couldn&#x2019;t she? After all, she&#x2019;d made it into med school. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her gaze out the narrow lab window took in the gunmetal sky over the medieval wet courtyard of <i>l&#x2019;�cole de m�decine</i>. Students bent into the November wind. Nine more years of this if she passed. Maybe ten.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see it&#x2019;s worth it when you find your calling. I hated my first autopsy, threw up,&#x201d; said Serge. &#x201c;Almost left medicine. But the next involved a homicide victim. The policeman asked the attending examiner questions. How he looked at the body for clues to solve the murder fascinated me.&#x201d; Serge shrugged. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s when I learned that the dead talk. I&#x2019;m learning how to listen.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s the living I&#x2019;d rather figure out,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serge took off his glasses, wiped them with the hem of his lab coat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been accepted into Pathology after my rotation.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She smiled, happy for him. &#x201c;Congrats, Serge.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serge shrugged. &#x201c;Take a walk. It will clear your head.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hung up her lab coat with LEDUC stitched on the lapel. The old-style thirties script reminded her of the Leduc Detective sign hanging over her father&#x2019;s office on rue du Louvre. She kicked off her scuffed clogs and stepped into her worn Texan cowboy boots, put on her leather jacket, and shouldered her bag.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Aim�e, what about your late lunch? We&#x2019;re heating up the <i>croque-madame</i>.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;All yours. Knock yourself out.&#x201d; She waved at Serge. She&#x2019;d lost her appetite.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Near the study lounge where everyone hung out between lectures, she looked for tall, blond Florent. They&#x2019;d met at the study group, almost two months now. She wanted to lean on his shoulder. No, face it&#x2014;she wanted to do a lot more than that. Crawl under the duvet with him, like the other night. The morning after, brioches in bed, skipping study group to lick off the buttery crumbs. Murmurs of a weekend in Brittany at his aristocratic family&#x2019;s country home.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn&#x2019;t see Florent among the loitering undergraduates. Time for a pee.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After checking the whole row of bathroom stalls, at last she found one with toilet paper and latched the door. The hall door opened&#x2014;voices, footsteps. The squeal of the faucet.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you tell me before? I love clubbing at Queen,&#x201d; said the nasal voice she recognized as Mimi&#x2019;s. Florent&#x2019;s sister was a third year. Tall and big toothed, Mimi reminded her of a horse. Water gushed from the faucet and she heard snickers.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aim�e flushed, pulled up her agent provocateur tights and headed toward the sinks.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I want to go with you, but Florent&#x2019;s engagement party is this weekend,&#x201d; said Mimi.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aim�e blinked.

He has served twice as president of the Science Fiction Writers of America and is currently an adjunct professor teaching writing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<i>Starred Review.</i> Hugo-winner Haldeman's skillful writing makes this unusually thoughtful and picaresque tale shine. Matt Fuller, a likable underachiever stuck as a lab assistant at a near-future MIT, is startled when the calibrator he built begins disappearing and reappearing, jumping forward in time for progressively longer intervals. Curiosity and some unfortunate accidents send Matt through a series of vividly described, wryly imagined futures where he gradually becomes more adaptable and resourceful as experiences hone his character. The young woman he rescues from a techno-religious dictatorship gives him a chance at a mature relationship, while teaming up with an AI that intends to press on to the end of time forces him to decide what he wants from life. Rather than being a riff on H.G. Wells's <i>The Time Machine</i>, this novel is closer in tone to Neil Gaiman's <i>Anansi Boys</i>, another charming yarn about a young man who's forced out of a boring rut. Producing prose that feels this effortless must be hard work, but Haldeman (<i>Camouflage</i>) never breaks a sweat. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

That fervor animates American history as much as it does the Middle East, in the present as deeply as in the past. <p></p>In Carroll&#x2019;s provocative reading of the deep past, the Bible came into being as an act of resistance to the violence that threatened Jerusalem from the start. Centuries later, holy wars burned apocalyptic Jerusalem into the Western mind, sparking expressly religious conflict among Jews, Christians, and Muslims. The heat stretched from Richard the Lionheart to Field Marshal Edmund Allenby, whose World War I conquest of the city relit the fuse for a war that still rages. <p></p>Carroll&#x2019;s brilliant leap is to show how, as Christopher Columbus was dispatched from the Crusades-obsessed Knights Templar&#x2019;s last outpost in Iberia, the New World too was powerfully shaped by the millennial obsessions of the City on a Hill &#x2014; from Governor Winthrop to Abraham Lincoln to Woodrow Wilson to Ronald Reagan. Heavenly Jerusalem defines the American imagination &#x2014; and always, the earthly city smolders. Jerusalem fever, inextricably tied to Christian fervor, is the deadly &#x2014; unnamed &#x2014; third party to the Israeli-Palestinian wars. Understanding Jerusalem fever is the key that unlocks world history, and the diagnosis that gives us our best chance to reimagine peace.</p><p><br> <strong>A Q &amp; A With Author James Carroll</strong> <br><br> <p><b>Q:</b> How did you become so personally invested in Jerusalem?</p> <p><b>A:</b> When I was young, I was a Catholic priest. After the turmoil of the Sixties, as I began to lose my grip on the priesthood, I needed to retreat to a place of spiritual and emotional sustenance. I spent a summer in a monastery on the edge of Jerusalem, overlooking the hills of the Judean desert. In my time there, and especially during endless forays in the city itself, I encountered a new depth of faith. Jerusalem&#x2019;s ancient resonance steadied me - not so much its traditional shrines, but its character as a place in which humans had transcended themselves age in and age out. It may seem odd to say so, but I came of age in Jerusalem. The figure of Jesus was quite real to me. I was able both to make the momentous decision to leave the priesthood, and to claim my Catholic faith in a new way. Of course, I was shocked by the contentions of Jerusalem, but those too were to the point. Where better for a young man in turmoil to find himself than in a place that is and has always been defined by turmoil?</p> <p><b>Q:</b> How did your work on anti-Semitism in <i>Constantine&#x2019;s Sword</i> influence your perceptions of Jerusalem?</p> <p><b>A:</b> The Israelis and the Palestinians are trapped in a corner - but it&#x2019;s not a corner of their own making. One of its walls is the long history of anti-Semitism that took root in Western civilization. Christian theology almost from the start assumes that Jews are to be exiled from the Jewish homeland. Christians take that exile - the so-called wandering Jew - as a proof of the claims that Jews reject. The collective, if unconscious, psyche of European culture is stamped with this denigration of Jews, tied to Jewish absence from Jerusalem. This accounts for much of the ambivalence about the Jewish return to Israel in 1948 (The Vatican, for example, did not recognize the state until 1994). It also accounts for a broad readiness to hold the State of Israel to higher standards of human rights than other states. Criticism of Israeli policies toward Palestinians is not anti-Semitism, but Israel&#x2019;s continuing vulnerability is at least in part explained by a widespread visceral uneasiness with Jews at home in Jerusalem.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> What is the second wall of the corner trapping Israelis and Palestinians?</p> <p><b>A:</b> Well, of course, it is colonialism. Just as Jews are still somehow at the mercy of deep history, so are Arabs. In their case, it is the history of racist, European contempt for colonized people. It is wrong to equate Zionism with colonialism, but Palestinians have every reason to regard their situation as an unjust consequence of 19th and 20th century imperial intrusions. The British method of colonial domination depended on stirring up local conflicts, whether in Ireland, India, or Palestine. That method still casts a shadow over Jerusalem, where seeds of Jewish-Arab conflict were so efficiently planted by the colonizers. In fact, the British decimated Palestinian civic and cultural institutions well before Israelis came to power. European anti-Semitism and colonialism have left a crippling legacy that amounts to a third party in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - but that third party is unacknowledged and unidentified. No one who shares in Western civilization has the right to condescend to the Jews and Arabs who are locked in this combat. I wrote this book to name that third party because only then can its power be undone.</p> <p><b>Q:</b>But how is the rest of the world tied to Jerusalem and its problems?</p> <p><b>A:</b> TQuite profoundly, although mostly unconsciously. It is not too much to say that the Western imagination - not just Europe now, but also America - took root and flowered in Jerusalem, more even than in Athens, Rome, or any other place. This begins, of course, with the Bible, and with the story of Jesus - Jerusalem is ground zero of Jewish and Christian religion. But across the centuries, the city remained pivotal. At the Crusades, Christendom "lost" Jerusalem to the Muslims, and the Biblical idea of a heavenly Jerusalem took on new force. Jerusalem as fantasy and as dream shaped Europe&#x2019;s idea of itself - and also its adventures and, ultimately, explorations. Christopher Columbus was driven by the idea of reclaiming Jerusalem, but so were the Puritans who came to New England. America understood itself from the start as a new Jerusalem, the "city on a hill." That vision influenced everyone from John Winthrop and Abraham Lincoln to Ronald Reagan and Sarah Palin. Today, a new American Christian nationalism takes its energy from apocalyptic fantasies fixed upon Jerusalem - which plays out even in the ways U.S. foreign policy treats Israel.</p> <br> <br>HMH&nbsp;hardcover, 2011Previous ISBN 978-0-547-19561-2</p><h2>Beaded Allure: Beadweaving Patterns for 25 Romantic Projects</h2><p><p><b>Fall in love with beading</b></p><p>Add a romantic twist to your creative time with <i>Beaded Allure</i>.

The famed ceramics of Deruta are certainly no exception. The first comprehensive book to celebrate the design and evolution of this extraordinary art form,<i> Deruta</i> is exquisitely illustrated with over 150 colorful photographs of coveted "majolica." The author and photographers, working with Melanie Doherty, who was a designer in Italy for several years, dramatically portray the splendors of this living tradition. We see the finest examples of Deruta tableware and tilework as well as garden decorations, fa?ades, altars, and architectural details. While some pieces are highly collectible, others are inexpensive and perfect for everyday use. <i>Deruta</i> also includes profiles of the artisans' studios and a gallery of their work, as well as evocative black-and-white photos of the hill town they call home. With a history of the craftan artistic heritage more than six centuries oldthis singular volume is a musthave for collectors and for anyone inspired by Deruta ceramics, decorative art pieces that evoke the spirit of the Italian countryside.</p><p>Susie Cushner is a Boston-based photographer whose work has appeared in House Beautiful, Metropolitan Home, and elsewhere.<br><br>David Hamilton is a San Francisco-based photographer whose images of landforms, artifacts, and archaeology are collected by numerous museums.<br><br>Elizabeth Helman Minchelli is the author of Private Rome and a contributor to Architectural Digest and Art and Antiques. She lives in Italy.These two stunning books differ in style and technique yet complement each other in beauty and execution. The first, published for the centenary of the New York State College of Ceramics in Alfred, is an exquisite and informative exhibition catalog celebrating the life and work of Charles Fergus Binns, a master potter, teacher, and founding director of the college. Introductory essays focus on Binns's career at the Royal Worcester Porcelain Works in England, the origins of the college, his successful combination of technical and artistic development, and his glazing techniques and Oriental influences. The book includes a catalogue raisonne of the exhibition. Color plates featuring 60 of the celebrated pieces serve as a visual introduction to the exhibit, while the rest of the photographs document Binns, his works, and the college. A third section of brief essays highlights the lives of 11 of Binns's most notable students, all masters in their own right. Deruta celebrates the achievements of the Umbrian hillside town celebrated since the 16th century for the colorfully glazed Italian ceramic pottery known as majolica. The book opens with a focus on the history of the town from the Middle Ages to the present, then moves on to detail the traditional production techniques and methods of decoration in use for centuries. The final section highlights the work of six family production studios in Deruta today. The book is generously illustrated with photos of these bold and vibrant works of art. Both titles are highly recommended for public and academic libraries alike.?Stephen Allan Patrick, East Tennessee State Univ.

They show how different cultures at different times have entwined physical capacities and mental mechanisms in order to construct a body adapted to moral ideas or social circumstances the body of a charismatic citizen or a visionary monk a mirror image of the world or a reflection of the spirit. Each volume emphasizes a particular perspective. Part 1 explores the human body&#39;s relationship to the divine, to the bestial, and to the machines that imitate or simulate it. Part 2 covers the junctures between the body&#39;s &#34;outside&#34; and &#34;inside&#34; by studying the manifestations - or production - of the soul and the expression of the emotions and, on another level, by examining the speculations inspired by cenesthesia, pain, and death. Part 3 brings into play the classical opposition between organ and function by showing how organs or bodily substances can be used to justify or challenge the way human societies function and, conversely, how political and social functions tend to make the bodies of the persons filling them the organs of a larger body - the social body or the universe as a whole.ContributorsMark Elvin, Catherine Gallagher, Fran�oise H�ritier Aug�, Julia Kristeva, William R.

When their parents die suddenly under mysterious circumstances, five-year-old Abby Evans and her six-year-old sister, Mallory, are adopted by their dad's friend Donovan Mitchell and his new wife. Troubled Mallory is sent off to an institution and banished from the now-prosperous Mitchell family for more than a decade. Still missing her sister, Abby suffers yet another loss when her boyfriend, Connor, dies suddenly. The sisters are finally reunited in their early 20s, and Abby's life seems complete once again, with a wonderful new man, an opulent house and an instantly successful writing career. Trouble soon arises, however, when Mallory becomes convinced that their parents, along with Connor and several others, were actually murderedAand that Donovan Mitchell is the culprit. Abby bases her newest novel on that idea, and the two young women hunt for the clues they hope will roound out the story and clarify their complex past. The evidence is inconclusive until Abby and Mallory throw a lavish book-completion party, at which a violent encounter leads to the truth. Although the plotting is marred by coincidences, Michaels has crafted a smoothly written, dramatic tale full of incident and emotion.

Visit her at maryalicemonroe.com and on Facebook.<br><br>Last night, Toy Sooner dreamed again of the turtle. It was always the same dream, one so vivid that when she awoke she was tangled in her sheets, disoriented and filled with a great, nameless yearning.<br><br>Toy sat on the precipice of the sand dune looking out over the wave-scarred beach. Another day was ending. Around her the sea oats were greening and above, a night-hawk streaked across the slowly deepening sky. The tide was coming in, carrying seashells, driftwood and long-harbored memories tumbling to the shore.<br><br>She identified with the loggerhead sea turtle in her dream. Was it merely that the turtles were on her mind? She searched the restless sea that spread out to forever under the vast sky. Out in the distant swells, the sea turtles were gathering for the nesting season. Toy sensed the mothers out there, biding their time until instinct drove them from the safety of the sea to become vulnerable on the beach and lay their eggs.<br><br>It was an emotional time of the year for her. Each May when the sea turtles returned to the Isle of Palms, she felt the presence of her beloved mentor, Olivia Rutledge, returning with them.<br><br>She hugged her knees closer to her chest. This small dune on this empty patch of beach was her sanctuary. She came often to this sacred spot&#x2014;to think, to remember, to find solace. She felt closer to Olivia Rutledge here&#x2014; Miss Lovie to everyone she'd met. This dune had been Miss Lovie's favorite spot, and on some nights, especially when the sun lowered and the birds quieted, as now, Toy imagined she heard Miss Lovie's voice in the sweet-scented offshore breezes.<br><br>It had been five years since old Miss Lovie had passed. Five years spanned a good chunk of her life, she thought, considering she'd only lived twenty-three. After Olivia Rutledge died, Toy had worked hard every day of those five years to make a better life for herself and for Little Lovie, her daughter. That had been a vow made at Miss Lovie's gravesite and a promise to her infant daughter.<br><br>"I did my best to keep my vow," she said aloud to Lovie Rutledge, feeling her spirit hovering close tonight. "I finished college, got a good job and I've made a nice home for Little Lovie. All tidy and cheery, with flowers on the table, like you taught me. I want so much to be a good mother." She rested her chin on her knee with a ragged sigh as the longing from the dream resurfaced.<br><br>"So, tell me, Miss Lovie. Why don't I feel that I am? Or content? I'm still like that turtle in my dream, swimming toward someplace I can't seem to get to."<br><br>A high pitched cry shattered her thoughts. "Mama!"<br><br>Toy's gaze darted toward the call. Her young daughter sat a distance from the shoreline surrounded by colorful plastic buckets and spades. Her long blond hair fell in salt-stiff streaks down her back as she bent over on hands and knees before the crude beginning of a sand castle.<br><br>"What do you want, Little Lovie?"<br><br>"Mama, come help me with my castle!"<br><br>Toy sighed, sorely tempted. "I'm working, honey."<br><br>"You're always working."<br><br>She saw a scowl flash across Little Lovie's face before she ducked her head and went back to her digging. Mingled in the muffled roar of the ocean she heard Olivia Rutledge's voice in her mind. <em>Stop what you're doing and play with your child!</em><br><br>Toy desperately wanted to play with her and enjoy each precious, fleeting moment with Little Lovie. She felt an all too familiar twinge of guilt and paused to allow her gaze to linger on her daughter. Little Lovie was carefully molding another tower with her chubby hands.<br><br>That child was happiest when she was at the seaside, Toy thought, her heart pumping with affection. Whether collecting shells, digging castles or rollicking in waves, as long as she had her toes in the sand she was content. She was only five years of age, yet Little Lovie was so much like Miss Lovie Rutledge that Toy sometimes believed the old woman's spirit had returned to settle in her namesake. For Toy, the sun rose and set on her child. And it was <em>for </em>her child's future that she gathered her discipline.<br><br>"Let me finish this report," she called back. "Then I'll come help you finish that sand castle."<br><br>"You promise?"<br><br>"I promise, okay?"<br><br>Her daughter nodded and Toy resolutely brushed away grains of sand from her notebook and returned to the report that was due by morning. She was an Aquarist and had been placed in charge of her own gallery at the South Carolina Aquarium. It was her first break and she needed to prove that she was capable of the responsibility.<br><br>The noseeums and mosquitoes were biting in the sticky humidity and blown sand stuck to her moist skin but she worked a while longer, determined to finish in the last of the day's light. A short while later she closed her notebook and raised her gaze toward her daughter. Another lopsided tower had been added to the castle.<br><br>But her daughter was gone.<br><br>Toy's breath caught in her throat as her eyes wildly scanned the beach. "Lovie!" she cried out, leaping to her feet.<br><br>"Mama, look!"<br><br>Toy swung her head around toward her daughter's voice. Little Lovie was arched on tiptoe at the water's edge. The bottom of her pink swimsuit was coated with a thick layer of damp sand and she was pointing excitedly toward the sea.<br><br>Toy ran across the beach to grasp hold of her daughter's slender shoulders. "You know you're not supposed to go near the water," she scolded, even as her eyes devoured her child and her hands gently wiped sand from her face. "You scared me half to death."<br><br>The five-year-old was oblivious to her mother's concern. Instead, her large blue eyes were riveted to something in the surf.<br><br>"It's right there," she cried, wiggling her pointed finger urgently. "I see it!"<br><br>"What do you see, a dolphin?" Toy turned her head back toward the Atlantic to peer into the rolling surf. Then she saw it. A large dark object floated at the surface not more than fifty feet out.<br><br>It wasn't a dolphin. She squinted and moved a step closer. Could it be a turtle? The dark hulk appeared lifeless in the waves. "You stay right here," she ordered in a no nonsense tone, and this time, Little Lovie didn't argue.<br><br>Toy rolled her pants higher up on her slender legs, coiled her shoulder length blond hair in a twist at the top of her head, then walked into the sea for a closer look. She felt the chilly spring water swirl at her ankles, calves and then dampen the hem of her shorts as she waded forward, intrigued by the shadowy object bobbing on the waves.<br><br>It <em>was </em>a turtle! It had to be at least two hundred pounds&#x2014;and it looked dead. What a pity, she thought and she wondered if this was a nesting female holding eggs. It was always a shame to lose an adult turtle, but to lose a nesting female was a tragedy. The loss was one of generations.<br><br>A wave carried the turtle closer and Toy's stomach clenched at the sight. It looked like she'd been floating for a long time. She was badly emaciated and the shell was dried and covered from tip to tip with barnacles.<br><br>"Poor Mama," she muttered. There'd been too many dead turtles washing ashore in the past few years. "Barnacle Bills" the turtle team called them, and this was another to add to the list. She'd call and have DNR pick the carcass up in the morning. Toy was about to turn back when she saw a flipper move.<br><br>"She can't be..." Toy bent forward, squinting. A breaker smacked her legs but she kept her eyes peeled on the turtle. A flipper moved again.<br><br>"She's alive!" she called out to Little Lovie.<br><br>The child jumped up and down, clapping her hands.<br><br>Toy hurriedly waded closer to Little Lovie to be heard. "Honey, I'm going to need some help. Run up to Flo's house and tell her to come right quick, hear? Can you do that?"<br><br>"Yes, ma'am!"<br><br>The child took off like a shot for the dunes. Just beyond was the white frame house of Florence Prescott, the leader of the island's turtle team. Flo was very active in the community and always out doing something for someone, but she was usually home at the dinner hour. At least Toy hoped she was today.<br><br>She turned back toward the turtle. The inert creature was floating with her posterior up, like a lopsided rubber raft. She'd have to haul her in. She sighed and looked at her clothes. Well, they were halfsoaked anyway, she thought as she began wading toward the turtle.<br><br>The pebbly sand suddenly dipped and sliding down, her toe was sliced by the sharp edge of a shell. White pain radiated up her leg and looking down, she saw the murky water stained red with blood. The turtle was drifting farther away in the current. Ignoring the pain, she kicked off to swim to the floating hulk.<br><br>The big turtle was in much sorrier shape than she'd first realized. As she drew near, the turtle's dark, almond eyes rolled in her large skull in a mournful gaze.<br><br>"Don't be afraid, big girl," she said to the turtle, feeling an instant connection. "I'll get you out of here in no time."<br><br>A small wave slapped her face as she swam around the turtle. Her eyes stung and she spit out a mouthful of saltwater. Once behind the rear flippers she could get a good handle on the shell. Then, using the carapace like a kickboard, she began kicking and pushing the turtle toward the shore.<br><br>She was making good progress when she caught a quick silvery flash of movement in the corner of her eye. Her breath hitched as she scanned the vista. The water's surface was turning glassy in the brilliant colors of the setting sun. She hesitated, not fooled by the serenity. Dusk was feeding time for sharks.<br><br>Toy knew she was in a vulnerable position. The predator would be curious about the sick turtle&#x2014;an easy prey. With her toe bleeding she knew the smart thing to do would be to leave the turtle and get out of the water.<br><br>Then she saw it again. This time it was unmistakable. The slim, v-shaped dorsal fin broke the surface, heading her way in a lazy, zigzag pattern. Toy froze as the shark neared, then swiftly veered off. The turtle's instinct flared and her flippers feebly stroked in the surf. The shark surfaced again, but this time farther out by the inlet.<br><br>"Well, no one ever said I was smart," she told herself, gripping the turtle's shell. With a grunt, she pushed with all her might, propelling the turtle forward. She repeated this twice more before her feet hit sand. The shark was closer again, circling in a pattern of surveillance.<br><br>That bull shark was four feet of sleek danger and she knew it could attack in shallow water. She hurried to the front of the turtle and grabbed hold. "We're not home yet," she muttered and began tugging the enormous turtle in. Behind her on the beach she heard Florence Prescott calling her name.<br><br>"Hurry, Flo!" she cried over her shoulder.<br><br>With athletic grace that belied her advanced years, Flo ran straight into the water, her tennis shoes still on.<br><br>"Drag her out of the water," Toy cried with urgency. "We've got company."<br><br>Flo looked over her shoulder. "God damn," she muttered.<br><br>Little Lovie ran into the surf, arms reaching for the turtle. "Let me help!"<br><br>"Lovie, you get back on the beach this instant!" Toy ordered.<br><br>"But I want to help!"<br><br>"Do as your mama says," Flo told her. "Sharks nibble hatchlings in ankle deep water and your toes are just the right size. Go on now, git."<br><br>Little Lovie scrambled out of the ocean.<br><br>Flo grabbed hold of a side of the turtle's shell. Her deeply tanned arms spoke of many years spent in the sun. "On the count of three..."<br><br>With a heave-ho, they shoved the turtle up the final few feet to the edge of the beach. Out of the water, the full impact of the huge turtle's weight was felt. It was like pushing a boulder and it took all they had to get the turtle to scrape sand till only the tips of the incoming tide caressed her rear flippers.<br><br>The turtle remained motionless. Toy plopped down on the sand beside her and lifted her foot to check out her wound. She was shocked to see that the cut in her big toe was deep and bright red blood trickled in a steady flow. And it hurt like hell. It hit her how reckless she'd been to stay in the sea with a bleeding wound. Raising her gaze, she looked again out at the sea. The shark had already disappeared beneath the murky water. She started to laugh with relief.<br><br>"What are you laughing at?" Flo asked. "Is that a cut you've got there?" She swooped down like a mother hen.<br><br>"It's nothing."<br><br>"I'll be the judge of that. Those shells can be like razors. Let me see it."<br><br>"Really, Flo, I'm okay."<br><br>"Bring it here." Flo bent and, grabbing hold of Toy's foot, studied the toe closer. She clucked her tongue. Little Lovie hovered nearby, mesmerized. After a quick perusal, Flo released the foot and rose to a stand. "Put some antibiotic ointment on it and you'll live."<br><br>Toy looked up at her daughter with a reassuring smile.<br><br>"I can't believe you went out there with a shark trailing you," Flo said. "You know better."<br><br>Toy took the scolding with good nature. "I didn't see it when I swam out and I wasn't sure I was bleeding." She snorted and added smugly, "But I got her in, didn't I?"<br><br>Florence Prescott usually had something upbeat to say about most things, but she looked at the turtle with a frown and shaking her head said, "I'm not sure it was worth the risk. This turtle looks barely alive. And she's covered with gunk. I've buried strandings that looked better than this one."<br><br>"No, she's beautiful. That gunk is merely leeches, algae and barnacles. We just have to get her someplace where we can clean her up."<br><br>Before they could discuss this further, their attention was caught by calls coming from up the beach. "Well, thank goodness the cavalry's here," Flo said. She stretched her arm overhead and waved, calling out, "Cara! Brett! Over here!"<br><br>Toy turned toward the dunes and saw an attractive couple in khaki shorts and green <em>Barrier Island Eco-Tour </em>T-shirts. Toy's spirits soared and she grinned from ear to ear as she lifted her arm in a wave.<br><br>A tall, lean woman strode toward them in a long-legged, no-nonsense manner. Her glossy, dark hair whipped in the breeze and behind her smart, tortoise sunglasses, Toy knew Cara's brown eyes were sparkling with excitement at the prospect of a live turtle on the beach.<br><br></p><h2>Cecile: Gates of Gold (Girls of Many Lands)</h2><p>In 1711, twelve-year-old CTcile Revel is given an unexpected chance to serve at King Louis XIV&#39;s court at the Palace of Versailles, but in serving as a lady-in-waiting, CTcile finds out how complicated, and precarious, life at court can be.

He is the author of several bestselling novels, including Mila 18, Armageddon, The Angry Hills, Exodus, Trinity, Battle Cry, Mitla Pass and Topaz.Sour, self-indulgent characters and surprisingly awkward dialogue suggest that only the staunchest Uris fans will enjoy his new novel. Since it draws on the bestselling author's own life, many will buy it anyway. Aspiring novelist Gideon Zadok's paean to the Marine Corps is hailed as the definitive combat novel of World War II. To soak up some of the gravy he feels is due him, the young author moves his wife Val and two daughters to Hollywood, where the chip on his shoulder increases exponentially in size. Blaming Val when his second book flops, he pays her back by sleeping with dozens of women; she, meantime, nags unceasingly. Flashbacks show that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree: Gideon's father was a bombastic Communist party organizer, while his dissatisfied mother hopped from one man to the next. With his marriage heading for divorce court and his career on the rocks, Gideon takes off for Israel to redeem himself as a writer and a Jew. On the eve of the 1956 Sinai War, he tries to prove his courage and face down his painful past by parachuting into Mitla Pass with a company of Israeli soldiers.

He is the author and editor of over twenty-five books and monographs including Critical Pedagogy and Predatory Culture, Revolutionary Multiculturalism, and Schooling as a Ritual Performance. His work has been published in twelve languages. Peter McLaren is professor in the Division of Urban Education at the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, University of California. He lectures worldwide on the politics of liberation and is considered one of the central architects of critical pedagogy. He has recently won the Paulo Freire Democratic Projects Award of Social Justice.Keeps the revolutionary spirit of Che and Freire alive and challenges readers, particularly educators, to engage the true meaning of a revolutionary praxis. A must-read for all those who dare embrace a truly revolutionary pedagogy of the oppressed. (Donaldo Macedo, University of Massachusetts, Boston)<br><br>In a probing posthumous meditation on the life and work of Ernesto "Che" Guevara and Paulo Freire, Peter McLaren not only recalls their history but reasserts the continued influence for our own times of these two revolutionary teachers. (Barbara Harlow, University of Texas, Austin)<br><br>In this lucid and theoretically informed reappraisal of the legacies of Che and Freire, Peter McLaren has made a significant contribution to a renewed Marxist theory. Where critiques of capitalism seem to be out of fashion, this volume engages the lives of two great revolutionaries in the context of 'globalization' and increasing class inequality. (Rodolfo D. Torres, professor, University of California, Irvine; visiting professor, University of Glasgow, Scotland)<br><br>An enlightening reaffirmation of revolutionary theory and practice, much needed as an antidote to this age of free-market imperialism. (Michael Parenti, author of The Face of Imperialism and God and His Demons)<br><br>A book on Che Guevera and Paulo Freire? Once again Peter McLaren has asked scholars and educators to confront our own political limitations and imagine the unimaginable: Educational revolution is achievable. McLaren passionately turns to the revolutionary spirit of these two icons in a work that rivals the intensity of Jonathan Kozol's work. I predict McLaren's book will have equal impact on the educational community. He invites the reader to boldly act in the name and the body of the poor and dispossessed. Scholarship in education can have no higher ambition. (Louis F. Mir�n, University of California, Irvine, Author of <i>The Social Construction of Urban Schooling<i>)<br><br>Peter McLaren's <i>Che Guevara, Paulo Freire</i> is a vigorous intervention in the complexity of the contemporary political situation&#x2015;from rearticulating the project of radical pedagogy to his argument to reorient the left itself. Through his groundbreaking regrasping of Che's revolutionary practices,McLaren critiques the left&#x2015;especially progressive left pedagogy&#x2015;for its marginalization of class and complacent reformism. In an effective intervention, he puts the international class struggle at the forefront of a revolutionary pedagogy. As part of his argument for the reorganization of social institutions in <i>Che Guevara, Paulo Freire</i>, McLaren offers a sustained radical critique of transnational neoliberalism and its corporatization of education&#x2015;in doing so, he places revolutionary pedagogy in solidarity with the oppressed of global capitalism. (Teresa L. Ebert, Author of <i>Ludic Feminism and After<i>)<br><br>Truly impressive both in terms of the wide range of discourses, issues and topics which it addresses and connects, as well as the breadth and depth of the contribution it makes to the theory and practice of critical pedagogy. (Richard Harris, California State University; author of Death of a Revolutionary: Che Guevara's Last Mission)<br><br>A sweeping and provocative work that raises pedagogical theory to new heights. Professor McLaren deftly weaves together the critical educational legacy of Paulo Freire, the revolutionary spirit of Che Guevara, and some of the best elements of contemporary radical social thought to arrive at a powerful synthesis of historical analysis and political vision. (Carl Boggs, National University; author of The Two Revolutions: Gramsci and the Dilemmas of Western Marxism and Social Movements and Political Power)<br><br>Peter McClaren, in his new book, <i>Che Guevara and Paulo Freire</i>, has eloquently summed up for the next millenium what critical pedagogy inspired by the life-works of Che and Freire has to offer: not a utopia of private pleasure and desire preached by Rorty and other neoliberal apologists but a life-enhancing praxis of personal and social transformation needed to renew the ecosystem exhausted by global capitalism. We have much to learn from the visionary reason of these two great heroic "guerillas" of the much maligned "third world." (E. San Juan, Jr., Department of Comparative American Cultures, Washington State University)<br><br>McLaren's exploration into the similar and divergent theoretical positions of Che and Freire's contributions to our understanding of a revolutionary socialist vision is impeccable. Through critically examining the tremendous intellectual fortitude and unwavering practice of these two prominent left intellectuals of this century, he unearths the often forgotten explicatory depth and political dynamism of historical materialism. By so doing, McLaren assists educators to engage more profoundly with the current crisis of global capitalism, in order to construct a renewed socialist project for the new millennium.

After the liberation the young survivor became caught up in Europe s robust black market.

This book will appeal to students of European History, Judaica and World War II. It is a valuable document that will be welcomed in the classroom, the library and on any history bookshelf.Michael Krasny , host of KQED Forum in San Francisco hails Taking Risks by Joe Pell and Fred Rosenbaum: &#34;Though there are many holocaust memoirs, the stories of those brave men and women who fought back with the partisans is often overshadowed by stories of those who fled or survived the concentration camps. Joseph Pell&#39;s story is an especially compelling one not only because of his heroic actions in the face of the Nazi juggurnaut and the rampant and often lethal Ukranian and Polish anti-semitism, but it is an American immigrant success story as well.&#34;</p><h2>Return to Freedom: The War Memoirs of Colonel Samuel C.

Writing with characteristic wit and an ability to clarify complex phenomena (the New York Times described his style as &#x201d;the sort of science writing that makes the reader feel like a genius&#x201d;), Richard Dawkins confronts this ancient mystery.</p><p>Nearly a century and a half after Charles Darwin formulated it, the theory of evolution is still the subject of considerable debate. Oxford scientist Richard Dawkins is among Darwin's chief defenders, and an able one indeed-- witty, literate, capable of turning a beautiful phrase. In <i>River Out of Eden</i> he introduces general readers to some fairly abstract problems in evolutionary biology, gently guiding us through the tangles of mitochondrial DNA and the survival-of-the- fittest ethos. (Superheroes need not apply: Dawkins writes, "The genes that survive . . . will be the ones that are good at surviving in the average environment of the species.") Dawkins argues for the essential unity of humanity, noting that "we are much closer cousins of one another than we normally realize, and we have many fewer ancestors than simple calculations suggest."<b>Richard Dawkins</b> is the first holder of Oxford University's newly endowed Charles Simonyi Professorship in the Public Understanding of Science. He is the author of two acclaimed bestsellers, <i>The Blind Watchmaker</i>, which won both the Royal Society of Literature Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize in Science, and the even better known <i>The Selfish Gene</i>.</p><h2>The Senses Considered As Perceptual Systems</h2><p>Gibson&#39;s 1966 book, The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems, which presents many revolutionary ideas that are important not only for the study of perception but also for the science of psychology in general including the rejection of the mechanistic and dualistic stimulus-response formula (cf.

"A man loses power when he pities."</p> <p>Nietzche went mad in the year Adolph Hitler was born, but Hitler carried on that philosophy. He despised other people and stood apart from them. He especially despised the weak and the handicapped, and he developed programs for exterminating them. Robert Payne wrote, "Even on festive occasions he remained singularly alone, the flow of emotion ceasing abruptly when it came in contact with him. . . . He demanded for himself an immunity from people" (The Life and Death of Adolph Hitler, Praeger, p. 461). What a contrast to Jesus Christ, the compassionate Son of Man! In his Gospel, Dr. Luke describes our Lord as one who mingled with people, including publicans and sinners, and who shared the burdens of the afflicted and the weak. Jesus has proved conclusively that pity is a sign of strength, not of weakness; and that God's power flows through loving hearts.</p> <p>I think it was George Bernard Shaw who said that if the other planets are inhabited, they must be using the earth as their insane asylum. Our world is filled with hurting people who need a loving touch and a word of encouragement. Jesus has put His people here to let the world know that He cares. His command to us is, "Be compassionate!"</p></p><p><b>Dr. Warren W.

Thoroughly researched and amply documented, <i>The New Leviathan </i>over�turns the conventional wisdom about which end of the political spectrum represents the rich and pow�erful, and which represents the people. <br> <br>The Democratic Party presents itself to the electorate as the party of working families and the poor. In the 2000 election campaign, Democrat Al Gore ran on the slogan &#x201c;The People vs. the Powerful,&#x201d; while President Obama describes him�self as a &#x201c;grassroots organizer&#x201d; and a spokesman for &#x201c;fairness&#x201d; and &#x201c;progressive change.&#x201d; Such is the world of political myth. In reality, the Demo�crats and the Obama progressives represent the richest and most powerful political machine in American history. Backed by a near trillion-dollar treasury in America&#x2019;s oldest and largest tax-exempt foundations, progressives outspend conservatives by a factor of seven to one. <br> <br>In <i>The New Leviathan</i>, David Horowitz and Jacob Laksin examine this growing financial power of left-wing organizations and politicians. They show how left-wing foundations under�wrote the political career of Barack Obama and how massive funding advantages for progressive proposals have disenfranchised American voters and shifted the national policy debate dramatically to the left. <i>The New Leviathan </i>draws connections between the Obama administration and progres�sive organizations from labor unions to media outlets to nonprofits to political groups, and shows how on key policy fronts&#x2014;national security, immigration, citizenship, environment, and health care&#x2014;the sheer force of left-wing financial resources has reconfigured the nation&#x2019;s political agenda.</p><p>David Horowitz is the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of, among other books, <i>One-Party Classroom,</i> <i>The Professors</i>,<i> Radical Son</i>, <i>The Shadow Party</i>, and<i> Party of Defeat</i>. He is president of the David Horowitz Freedom Center in Los Angeles.&nbsp;<br><br>Jacob Laksin is the managing editor of <i>Front-Page Magazine</i> and coatuhor of <i>One-Party Classroom.</i> His articles and reviews have also appeared in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, the <i>Weekly Standard</i>,<i> National Review Online</i>, <i>RealClearWorld</i>, and the <i>Washington Examiner</i>.1.<br><br>The New Leviathan<br><br>This book is about a political force of unprecedented magnitude in American life. The &#x201c;New Leviathan&#x201d; is a network of billion-dollar tax-exempt foundations and advocacy think tanks that work in concert with government unions and grassroots radical groups to make up the organizational core of the political left. The New Leviathan is not only a political force in the narrow sense of directly influencing electoral outcomes through the support of candidates and parties. Because its power derives from institutions whose mandates are educational and philanthropic, its influence extends into every aspect of the nation&#x2019;s life. This influence is exerted through a tax-exempt universe of policy think tanks, grassroots campaign organizations, and public-interest groups, created and supported by its donations. The components of the New Leviathan operate within the framework of a &#x201c;progressive&#x201d; ideology that promotes an ever-expanding state, along with policies that undermine America&#x2019;s sovereignty and weaken her defenses. The New Leviathan&#x2019;s ever-growing power has already tipped the scales of the national political debate and, as we will show in this volume, transformed its very nature.<br><br>Conventional wisdom would dismiss the very possibility of such dominance in the political arena by a money machine of the Left. In the conventional view, it is Republicans and the political right with their corporate sponsors and big-money donors who make up the &#x201c;party of the rich,&#x201d; while progressives speak for the powerless and the poor. In this perspective, conservatives are agents of an economic &#x201c;ruling class,&#x201d; organized to defend its social privileges. In the exercise of financial power in politics, conservatives are assumed to enjoy an overweening advantage, utilizing unrivaled resources to orchestrate &#x201c;vast right-wing conspiracies,&#x201d; which are designed to thwart progressive efforts in behalf of equality and &#x201c;social justice.&#x201d;<br><br>While casting conservatives as mouthpieces for the rich, the same perspective portrays Democrats as the party of &#x201c;working Americans and their families,&#x201d; providing a voice for the voiceless and a shield for the disadvantaged. Accepting the Democratic Party&#x2019;s presidential nomination in 2000, Al Gore summed up this outlook in a slogan: &#x201c;They&#x2019;re for the powerful; we&#x2019;re for the people!&#x201d; 1<br><br>The political melodrama in which Democrats and progressives posture as paladins of enlightenment has a long and unpretty history. It was forged during the moderately populist and immoderately corrupt presidency of Andrew Jackson, spokesman for the &#x201c;common man,&#x201d; who entered the White House as a self-proposed champion of the people battling the &#x201c;moneyed elite.&#x201d; Both the image and the aura were transparent manipulations to seduce a willing public. Despite humble beginnings, Jackson was a man of means who basked in the privileges of an aristocratic life. The same comfortable circumstances did not discourage him from plundering the property of his political rivals, or justifying his avarice as a &#x201c;sharing&#x201d; of the wealth, or from exploiting the morality play he had created to expand his personal power. Nor did Jackson&#x2019;s &#x201c;everyman&#x201d; enthusiasms keep him from owning and selling slaves throughout his life or from presiding over the forced removal of American Indian tribes from their native lands on the &#x201c;Trail of Tears.&#x201d;<br><br>Politics being a market in which fictions are currency, the Jacksonian myth established the enduring template of the two-party system. As a Republican newspaper in Tennessee complained, &#x201c;The rank and file of the democratic party honestly believes . . . the democratic party is the poor man&#x2019;s party, that the republican party is the party of boodle and corruption and that they obtain and maintain their supremacy in all the states by the undue use of money.&#x201d;2<br><br>Franklin Roosevelt entered the White House a hundred years after Jackson, and despite being a born aristocrat, a &#x201c;son of privilege who never depended on a pay check,&#x201d; he was also able to frame his presidential tenure as &#x201c;the Era of the Common Man.&#x201d;3 In the 1970s, Jimmy Carter took up the folksy mantle, touting himself as a simple peanut farmer from Georgia and promising to be the &#x201c;people&#x2019;s president.&#x201d; Yet Carter was the son of a wealthy plantation owner, inherited his own business, and spurned a lucrative job in the private sector in order to sow the seeds of a political career with a tale of humble beginnings.4 Carter&#x2019;s claim to be a progressive was particularly dubious since he won his 1970 gubernatorial campaign by courting the support of southern segregationists and projecting what one biographer has called a &#x201c;not-so-subtle racism&#x201d; away from public view.5<br><br>In the election of 2000, Al Gore, another scion of an elite segregationist family, took up the populist theme with the campaign slogan, &#x201c;The People vs. the Powerful.&#x201d; As part of a White House that set records fund-raising from &#x201c;special interests,&#x201d; Gore&#x2019;s claim was hardly credible, although a politically sympathetic media helped to make it seem so. After losing the presidency, Gore launched a new career posing himself as the people&#x2019;s champion against global polluters, even winning an Academy Award and a Nobel Prize from fellow progressives for these efforts while trampling on the environment and making himself a wealthy man in the process. Today, Gore travels the world on private carbon-gorging jets and spends an estimated $30,000 a year to heat just one of his luxury mansions, which include a recently purchased $9 million villa in Montecito, California, with six bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a large pool house, and six fireplaces.6 His stake in a &#x201c;green&#x201d; energy company that profits from lucrative environmentally correct government contracts has positioned him to become the world&#x2019;s first &#x201c;carbon billionaire.&#x201d;7<br><br>Populist hypocrisy was on display again and in a particularly sordid fashion during the next national election when Democratic vice-presidential candidate John Edwards cast America as a benighted home of the oppressed. According to Edwards, there were &#x201c;two Americas&#x201d;--on the one hand, the rich Republican America with its boot heel on the necks of the hapless and helpless; on the other, the Democrat America of the poor and voiceless (if not for noble crusaders like Edwards). Back on earth this selfless servant of the workingman had accumulated a personal net worth of $188 million, while his running mate, John Kerry, had married into two fortunes three times the size of Edwards&#x2019;s own, making him the richest lawmaker in the country.8 Kerry&#x2019;s opulence was not untypical of the balance between the parties: among the twelve richest lawmakers, Democrats outnumber Republicans three to one.9<br><br>The ability to see itself as a perennial underdog in a class war it regards as integral to capitalism is an abiding strength of the political left. But the image is unsupported by the facts. Far from being the party of the people, Democrats and their progressive core represent America&#x2019;s social and cultural elites and constitute the richest, the most organized, and most economically powerful political force in American history. As Christopher Caldwell observed in a New York Times essay, &#x201c;the Democratic Party is the party to which elites belong. It is the party of Harvard (and most of the Ivy League), of Microsoft and Apple (and most of Silicon Valley), of Hollywood and Manhattan (and most of the media) and, although there is some evidence that numbers are evening out in this election cycle, of Goldman Sachs (and most of the investment banking profession). . . . The Democrats have the support of more, and more active, billionaires [than the Republicans]. Of the twenty richest ZIP codes in America, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, 19 gave the bulk of their money to the Democrats in the last election, in most cases the vast bulk--86 percent in 10024 on the Upper West Side.&#x201d; 10<br><br>Wall Street--the very symbol of capitalist excess and wealth--was a key player in Barack Obama&#x2019;s successful presidential election run in 2008. Counterintuitive at first, this fact becomes immediately intelligible once one realizes that big government works for Wall Street bankers who float all the bonds that underwrite government spending programs and take their percentage on every dollar of big government debt. Award-winning business reporter Charles Gasparino observes: &#x201c;. . . the assumption made by most Americans, . . . [is] that because investment bankers are rich they must favor Republicans because, by definition, Republicans favor lower taxes on the wealthy and on big business. And while, of course, no one likes high taxes, what&#x2019;s more important than the tax rate is how much income you make in the first place: paying 30 percent of your money in taxes if you make a million dollars is better than paying a 20 percent tax rate on an income of only half a million.&#x201d; 11<br><br>In light of these facts it is hardly surprising that the top financial backers of Barack Obama&#x2019;s presidential campaign included Wall Street leaders Jamie Dimon (CEO, JPMorgan Chase), Lloyd Blankfein (CEO, Goldman Sachs), Dick Fuld (CEO, Lehman Brothers), Warren Spector (CEO, Bear Stearns), Larry Fink (CEO, BlackRock--the world&#x2019;s largest money management firm), Greg Fleming (number two at Merrill Lynch), and Mark Gallogly (number two at the private equity firm Blackstone). Collectively, these Wall Street titans raised more than $100 million for the Obama campaign.12<br><br>It is a reflection on human vanity that the Left actually believes it is the people&#x2019;s David to the Right&#x2019;s Goliath. A recent display of this misplaced self-esteem was the now-famous PowerPoint presentation that former White House official Rob Stein screened for George Soros, Clinton political operatives, and Democratic funders as the 2004 election approached. The PowerPoint was called &#x201c;The Conservative Message Machine&#x2019;s Money Matrix,&#x201d; and Stein&#x2019;s goal was to persuade Democratic funders that they had to match the unfairly oversized conservative war chest in order to help the little people out.<br><br>Stein&#x2019;s presentation began with the false premise that conservatives enjoyed an overwhelming advantage in the resources they were able to funnel into American politics. In Stein&#x2019;s view, this advantage enabled conservatives not only to influence politics but to move the boundaries of the entire national debate to the right. Using charts and graphs, Stein purported to show that with just $300 million from two hundred &#x201c;anchor donors&#x201d; the conservative &#x201c;message machine&#x201d; was nonetheless able to fundamentally reshape the country&#x2019;s politics.13 &#x201c;This is perhaps the most potent, independent, institutionalized apparatus ever assembled in a democracy to promote one belief system,&#x201d; Stein told New York Times journalist Matt Bai, who didn&#x2019;t bother to check.14<br><br>In fact, Stein&#x2019;s figure was a modest sum in an age when one gubernatorial campaign can cost $170 million. But his portrait of an overweening and unanswered conservative message machine proved decisive in recruiting the left-wing billionaires in the room to underwrite a network of newly minted progressive organizations. The most prominent example was the Democracy Alliance, which was established in 2005 by Soros and a coalition of eighty leftist donors, each of whom contributed $1 million toward its creation.<br><br>The immediate goal of the Democracy Alliance was to lead the resurgence of the Left in the 2006 midterm elections. Almost half the groups the alliance funded hadn&#x2019;t existed only a few years before.15 In its inaugural year of operations, the Democracy Alliance distributed $50 million to assorted left-wing, tax-exempt think tanks and quasi political associations, a sum that increased to $80 million the following year. The alliance quickly became the most visible presence of the Left&#x2019;s immense and unappreciated financial power in shaping the political landscape.16<br><br>Long before Stein&#x2019;s presentation, the claim that the Right was massively funded compared to the Left was a standard piece of progressive folklore, supported by a bookshelf of left-wing tracts and pseudoscientific studies. In Moving a Public Policy Agenda: The Strategic Philanthropy of Conservative Foundations (1997), author Sally Covington charged that the conservative movement had relied on &#x201c;a substantial and interconnected institutional apparatus&#x201d; unrivaled by the Left in order to win the war of ideas and push the country rightward. Like Stein, Covington singled out a core of conservative foundations--Scaife, Bradley, Koch, and Olin--as the financial engine driving this ostensibly dramatic shift in the national ideology to the right. Yet, the Olin Foundation was so dedicated to this concerted effort that in 2005 it deliberately went out of business in accord with the wishes of its founder.17<br><br>A 1999 report by a progressive advocacy group, the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, made essentially the same argument. The report claimed that conservative foundations had contributed approximately $1 billion in the ten years between 1990 and 2000 to twenty leading conservative think tanks and were thereby able to produce a &#x201c;rightward shift in American politics.&#x201d; 18 So powerful were these foundations, according to the report, that they could prevail despite opposition to their political agenda from the majority of the country. In short, conservative money trumped the democratic will of the people. The identical thesis with nearly identical supporting evidence was argued in No Mercy: How Conservative Think Tanks and Foundations Changed America&#x2019;s Social Agenda. Its left-wing authors, academics Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic, claimed that by relying on the financial wealth of conservative funders like Bradley, Scaife, and Olin, the Right had been able to get federal policies enacted that the American people did not support.<br><br>The twin premises of all these narratives, including Stein&#x2019;s PowerPoint, was that conservatives could draw on far superior and unrivaled tax-exempt resources to change the nation&#x2019;s political discourse and move it to the right. Both premises were demonstrably false. As of 2009, the financial assets of the 115 major tax-exempt foundations of the Left identified by our researchers added up to $104.56 billion. Not only is this total not less than the financial assets of the 75 foundations of the Right, it was more than ten times greater.19<br><br>Of the &#x201c;Big Three&#x201d; conservative foundations that every one of the left-wing analyses cited (Bradley, Olin, Scaife), not one has (or had) assets exceeding a billion dollars. By way of contrast, fourteen progressive foundations do, including Gates, Ford, Robert Wood Johnson, Hewlett, Kellogg, Packard, MacArthur, Mellon, Rockefeller, Casey, Carnegie, Simons, Heinz, and the Open Society Institute.20 As already noted, the John M. Olin Foundation, which figures in each of the left-wing foundation narratives and has so alarmed the Left over the years as one of the conservative &#x201c;Big Three,&#x201d; actually terminated itself in 2005 and has been defunct ever since. No comparable progressive foundation has so far voluntarily put itself out of business.<br>1. http://academic.csuohio.edu/kneuendorf/content/cpuca/gorespch.htm.<br><br>2. Edward L.

What makes this story so special is its commitment to making recent scientific discovery accessible to children. Although the dinosaurs are personified, the fictionalization never becomes maudlin; while obviously directed at children, the story maintains a realistic viewpoint towards birth, life, and death. Exquisite color illustrations back Horner's theories by representing dinosaurs in a clear, anatomically realistic manner. Fossil evidence indicates that Maiasaura did raise their young in nests and were attentive parents. Other information, such as Maiasaura coloration or noise-making abilities, are more a matter of conjecture. The authors have filled the gaps of knowledge believably, although problems may arise when readers try to differentiate between fact and fiction. Personification such as ``Maia felt happy'' also detracts from an otherwise objective stance. Horner notes that it's impossible to hypothesize without taking the chance of being wrong, and that science could not progress if scientists were unwilling to constantly rethink and revise. That Horner and Gorman have chosen to share this process with children makes this an especially important book, despite its flaws. Cathryn A.

Nearly a decade after PTL's collapse and her first husband's incarceration, the unsinkable Tammy Faye has resurfaced with her own talk show, a second marriage, and a wig business. This autobiography is part of her return to the public eye, an attempt to explain her marriages, her ministry, and her mascara (after a fundamentalist childhood in which cosmetics were forbidden, Tammy Faye discovered at age 17 that ``what I lacked in breasts I more than made up for in eyelashes''). What results from these self-revelations is an often skewed version of reality. She denies that she ever enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle at Heritage USA (the purported air-conditioner in the doghouse was really just a heating unit) and rejects any notion of financial wrongdoing on Bakker's part. She sees his downfall as the result of a conspiracy led by Jerry Falwell and suggests that high members of the Reagan administration, such as Ed Meese, assisted in the plot. Although even Falwell's supporters would not claim him to be above reproach, many of Tammy Faye's accusations are simply unsupportable. And her narrative has clearly benefited from hindsight. Repeatedly, she describes herself as intuitively mistrusting Falwell and others, but claims that Jim never listened to her advice and that his poor decisions led them to ruin. Her version of the PTL scandal is certainly the most salacious part of the book, which at other times is riddled with aphorisms like ``Faith is spelled R-I-S-K'' and ``God wants us to prosper.'' Jessica Hahn is regarded as a seductive tart who deserves all blame, and Tammy Faye expresses wonder that anyone would consider Hahn attractive, since ``she didn't even have boobs.'' Only diehard PTL followers will have sufficient faith to waste their money on this. (Jim Bakker is also publishing a memoir; see p. 1392.)

Snyder is an author and editor living in southeastern Pennsylvania with his wife and two children.</p><h2>In Quietness and Confidence</h2><p>Author David Roper turns his poetic wit and thoughtful reflections to the pursuit of spiritual formation, &#34;that process by which Christ is formed in us-for our sake, for God&#39;s sake, and for the sake of others.&#34; In each of the 31 readings, the author begins with a Scripture text, presents a brief essay based on the text, then adds a question or two to stimulate application and further study.</p><p>Taking on the responsibility of being a provider, protector, leader, and teacher all wrapped up into one superhero identity can be overwhelming. However, David Roper reminds you that your human nature comes with limits and &#x201c;Through His creative skill and by His ongoing grace your limits can become the means by which God uses you to touch others in singular and uncommon ways."&nbsp;Speaking directly to the heart of men, Roper encourages you to break away from the busyness of life and spend some time each day with God. In this 31-day devotional book, you&#x2019;ll find inspiring meditations, Scripture selections, and relevant quotes on the topics of purity, courage, legacy, and love.&nbsp;&#x201c;God has called you to a Great Adventure,&#x201d; says Roper. &#x201c;Follow Him in obedience&#x2014;do the very next thing He asks you to do&#x2014;and see what happens!&#x201d; Discover how you can become a man of God who displays His character in every area of life.<p>David Roper&nbsp;served as a pastor for many years. Now, he and his wife, Carolyn, offer encouragement and counsel to pastoral couples through Idaho Mountain Ministries.

In writings from the extended periods during which Calvino lived alone in Paris and New York, we witness his struggle to find "the right distance between being involved and being detached." In "American Diary" he recounts his peregrinations throughout the United States in 1959 and 1960: from New York to Texas, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Savannah, and Charleston. He describes his bafflement with heretofore unimaginable technology, his fascination with the Beats, his horror at the squalor of the suburbs, the inspiration he derived from Martin Luther King, Jr.'s words and actions, his impressions of myriad aspects of American culture. <br><br>Filled with the author's characteristic insight, intelligence, and brio, <b>Hermit in Paris</b> will take its place alongside Italo Calvino's seminal works.</p><p>Italo Calvino&#x2019;s works include<b> Numbers in the Dark</b>, <b>The Road to San Giovanni</b>, <b>Six Memos for the Next Millennium</b>, <b>The Baron in the Trees</b>, <b>If on a Winter&#x2019;s Night a Traveller</b>, <b>Invisible Cities</b>, <b>Marcovaldo</b>, and <b>Mr. Palomar</b>.

He was unable to make eye contact or connect with other children, much to his distress, and by the time he was a teenager his odd habits - such as a tendency to obsessively dismantle radios and dig five-foot holes (and stick his little brother in them) - had earned him the label &#39;social deviant&#39;. It was not until he was forty that an insightful therapist told Robison he had the form of autism called Asperger&#39;s syndrome, transforming the way Robison saw himself - and the world. Look Me in the Eye is Robison&#39;s moving and blackly funny story of growing up with Asperger&#39;s syndrome at a time when the diagnosis didn&#39;t even exist. A born storyteller, Robison takes us inside the head of a boy whom teachers and other adults regarded as defective and who still has a peculiar aversion to using people&#39;s given names (he calls his wife Unit Two). Above all, you&#39;ll marvel at the way Robison overcame the restrictions of Asperger&#39;s to gain the connection he always craved: as a husband and father.</p><p>John Robison lives with his wife and son in Amherst, Massachusetts. His company, J E Robison Service, repairs and restores classic cars such as Jaguars, Land Rovers, Rolls Royces and Bentleys.

And that's why I whacked him. Bang! On both ears, just like I saw on The Three Stooges. Being three years old was no excuse for disorderly play habits.<br><br>For example, I would use my mother's kitchen spoon to scoop out a ditch. Then, I would carefully lay out a line of blue blocks. I never mixed my food, and I never mixed my blocks. Blue blocks went with blue blocks, and red blocks with red ones. But Doug would lean over and put a red block on top of the blue ones.<br><br>Couldn't he see how wrong that was?<br><br>After I had whacked him, I sat back down and played. Correctly.<br><br>Sometimes, when I got frustrated with Doug, my mother would walk over and yell at me. I don't think she ever saw the terrible things he did. She just saw me whack him. I could usually ignore her, but if my father was there, too, he would get really mad and shake me, and then I would cry.<br><br>Most of the time, I liked Doug. He was my first friend. But some of the things he did were just too much for me to handle. I would park my truck by a log, and he would kick dirt on it. Our moms would give us blocks, and he would heap his in a sloppy pile and then giggle about it. It drove me wild.<br><br>Our playdates came to an abrupt end the following spring. Doug's father graduated from medical school and they moved far, far away to an Indian reservation in Billings, Montana. I didn't really understand that he could leave despite my wishes to the contrary. Even if he didn't know how to play correctly, he was my only regular playmate. I was sad.<br><br>I asked my mother about him each time we went to the park, where I now played alone. "I'm sure he'll send you a postcard," my mother said, but she had a funny look on her face, and I didn't know what to make of it. It was troubling.<br><br>I did hear the mothers whispering, but I never knew what they meant.<br><br>". . . drowned in an irrigation ditch . . ."<br><br>". . . the water was only six inches deep . . ."<br><br>". . . must have fallen on his face . . ."<br><br>". . . his mother couldn't see him, so she went outside and found him there . . ."<br><br>What is an irrigation ditch? I wondered. All I could figure out was, they weren't talking about me. I had no idea Doug was dead until years later.<br><br>Looking back, maybe my friendship with Doug wasn't the best omen. But at least I stopped whacking other kids. Somehow I figured out that whacking does not foster lasting friendship.<br><br>That fall, my mother enrolled me at Philadelphia's Mulberry Tree Nursery School. It was a small building with kids' drawings on the walls and a dusty playground enclosed with a chain-link fence. It was the first place where I was thrown together with children I didn't know. It didn't go well.<br><br>At first, I was excited. As soon as I saw the other kids, I wanted to meet them. I wanted them to like me. But they didn't. I could not figure out why. What was wrong with me? I particularly wanted to make friends with a little girl named Chuckie. She seemed to like trucks and trains, just like me. I knew we must have a lot in common.<br><br>At recess, I walked over to Chuckie and patted her on the head. My mother had shown me how to pet my poodle on the head to make friends with him. And my mother petted me sometimes, too, especially when I couldn't sleep. So as far as I could tell, petting worked. All the dogs my mother told me to pet had wagged their tails. They liked it. I figured Chuckie would like it, too.<br><br>Smack! She hit me!<br><br>Startled, I ran away. That didn't work, I said to myself. Maybe I have to pet her a little longer to make friends. I can pet her with a stick so she can't smack me. But the teacher intervened.<br><br>"John, leave Chuckie alone. We don't hit people with sticks."<br><br>"I wasn't hitting her. I was trying to pet her."<br><br>"People aren't dogs. You don't pet them. And you don't use sticks."<br><br>Chuckie eyed me warily. She stayed away for the rest of the day. But I didn't give up. Maybe she likes me and doesn't know it, I thought. My mother often told me I would like things I thought I wouldn't, and sometimes she was right.<br><br>The next day, I saw Chuckie playing in the big sandbox with a wooden truck. I knew a lot about trucks. And I knew she wasn't playing with her truck correctly. I would show her the right way. She will admire me and we will be friends, I thought. I walked over to her and took the truck away and sat down.<br><br>"Miss Laird! John took my truck!"<br><br>That was fast!<br><br>"I did not! I was showing her how to play with it! She was doing it wrong!" But Miss Laird believed Chuckie, not me. She led me away and gave me a truck of my own. Chuckie didn't follow. But tomorrow was another day. Tomorrow, I would succeed in making friends.<br><br>When tomorrow came, I had a new plan. I would talk to Chuckie. I would tell her about dinosaurs. I knew a lot about dinosaurs, because my father took me to the museum and showed me. Sometimes I had scary dreams about them, but overall, dinosaurs were the most interesting thing I knew of.<br><br>I walked over to Chuckie and sat down.<br><br>"I like dinosaurs. My favorite is the brontosaurus. He's really big."<br><br>Chuckie did not respond.<br><br>"He's really big but he just eats plants. He eats grass and trees.<br><br>"He has a long neck and a long tail."<br><br>Silence.<br><br>"He's as big as a bus.<br><br>"But an allosaurus can eat him."<br><br>Chuckie still didn't say anything. She looked intently at the ground, where she was drawing in the sand.<br><br>"I went to see the dinosaurs at the museum with my dad.<br><br>"There were little dinosaurs, too.<br><br>"I really like dinosaurs. They're neat!"<br><br>Chuckie got up and went inside. She had completely ignored me!<br><br>I looked down at the ground where she had been staring. What was she looking at that was so interesting? There was nothing there.<br><br>All my attempts to make friends had failed. I was a failure. I began to cry. Alone in the corner of the playground, I sobbed and smashed the toy truck into the ground again and again and again, until my hands hurt too much to do it anymore.<br><br>At the end of recess, I was still there, sitting by myself. Staring into the dirt. Too humiliated to face the other kids. Why don't they like me? What's wrong with me? That was where Miss Laird found me.<br><br>"It's time to go back inside." She grabbed my little paw and towed me in. I wanted to roll up in a ball and disappear.<br><br>Recently, one of my friends read the passage above and said, "Shit, John, you're still that way now." He's right. I am. The only real difference is that I have learned what people expect in common social situations. So I can act more normal and there's less chance I'll offend anyone. But the difference is still there, and it always will be.<br><br>People with Asperger's or autism often lack the feelings of empathy that naturally guide most people in their interactions with others. That's why it never occurred to me that Chuckie might not respond to petting in the same way a dog would. The difference between a small person and a medium-sized dog was not really clear to me. And it never occurred to me that there might be more than one way to play with a toy truck, so I could not understand why she objected to my showing her.<br><br>The worst of it was, my teachers and most other people saw my behavior as bad when I was actually trying to be kind. My good intentions made the rejection by Chuckie all the more painful. I'd watched my parents talk to other grown-ups and I figured I could talk to Chuckie. But I had overlooked one key thing: Successful conversations require a give and take between both people. Being Aspergian, I missed that. Totally.<br><br>I never interacted with Chuckie again.<br><br>I stopped trying with any of the kids. The more I was rejected, the more I hurt inside and the more I retreated.<br><br>I had better luck dealing with grown-ups. My disjointed replies didn't bring the conversation to an abrupt halt. And I tended to listen to them more than I listened to kids, because I assumed they knew more. Grown-ups did grown-up things. They didn't play with toys, so I didn't have to show them how to play. If I tried to pet a grown-up with a stick, he'd take it away. He wouldn't humiliate me by yelling and running to the teacher. Grown-ups explained things to me, so I learned from them. Kids weren't so good at that.<br><br>Most of the time, I played by myself, with my toys. I liked the more complex toys, especially blocks and Lincoln Logs. I still remember the taste of Lincoln Logs. When I wasn't chewing them, I made forts and houses and fences. When I got a little bigger, I got an Erector Set. I was very proud of that. I built my first machines with the Erector Set.<br><br>Machines were never mean to me. They challenged me when I tried to figure them out. They never tricked me, and they never hurt my feelings. I was in charge of the machines. I liked that. I felt safe around them. I also felt safe around animals, most of the time. I petted other people's dogs when we went to the park. When I got my poodle, I made friends with him, too.<br><br>"Look what your grandpa Jack sent you, John Elder!" (My parents named me John Elder Robison to honor my great-grandpa John Glenn Elder, who died before I was born.) My dad had brought home a wooly, ill-tempered, and probably genetically defective dog, most likely a reject from some dog pound. But I didn't know that. I was fascinated. He growled at me and wet the floor when my father put him down.<br><br>I wasn't scared of him, because he was considerably smaller than me. I had not yet learned that sharp teeth can come in small packages.<br><br>"Poodles are very smart dogs," my father told me.<br><br>Maybe he was smart, but he wasn't very friendly. I nam...</p><h2>Sirens and Sea Monsters (Tales from the Odyssey, 3)</h2><p>In these books based on episodes from Homer&#39;s Odyssey, Mary Pope Osborne brings to life the exciting adventures of one of the greatest heroes of all time. Now in paperback!</p><p>Mary Pope Osborne is the author of the best-selling series The Magic Tree House. She has also written many acclaimed retellings of myths and folktales and works of historical fiction.Grade 3-9-Closely following Book 12 of the Odyssey, Osborne relates the tale of Odysseus and his men as they travel back from the Land of the Dead to Circe's Island. Circe warns Odysseus of dangers ahead; he and his men soldier on to the seas of the monster Scylla, where six men are viciously eaten, as Circe had foretold. Heeding her words, Odysseus tries to talk his men out of stopping at Helios's island, but they insist, defying the gods by eating Helios's cattle, resulting in their deaths. Odysseus is left alone, floating through the seas, until he lands on the shores of Calypso's island. Osborne presents a readable version of the old story, retaining Homeric refrains and using the descriptive language found in better translations. The story is not modernized, yet will appeal to today's readers. The book includes a helpful map, and end matter such as a pronunciation guide, a list of the major gods and goddesses, sources, and information about Homer and his works. Young readers will find the adventures of Odysseus intriguing, and reluctant middle- to high-school readers could gain access to the Odyssey through this series.<br><i>Angela J.

Fed&#x2013;up, the elder Newbys one day made him one: &#x201c;We&#x2019;re sending you to Sheffield with the Gown Collection.&#x201d; And thus began his improbable, hilarious career as a commercial traveler for the antediluvian family firm, Lane &amp; Newby Ltd., &#x201c;Mantle Manufacturers and Wholesale Costumiers.&#x201d; <i>Something Wholesale,</i> originally published in 1962 and added to in the &#x2019;70s and &#x2019;80s, is one of the sweetest, funniest, and most touchingly unassuming memoirs I&#x2019;ve ever read. (If you just want to call it Newby&#x2019;s best book, there&#x2019;ll be no argument from us.)Eric Newby was born in London in 1919. In 1938, he joined the four-masted Finnish barque Moshulu as an apprentice and sailed in the last Grain Race from Australia to Europe, by way of Cape Horn. During World War II, he served in the Black Watch and the Special Boat Section. In 1942, he was captured and remained a prisoner-of-war until 1945. He subsequently married the girl who helped him to escape, and for the next fifty years, his wife Wanda was at his side on many adventures. After the war, he worked in the fashion business and book publishing but always travelled on a grand scale, sometimes as the Travel Editor for the Observer. He was made CBE in 1994 and was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award of the British Guild of Travel Writers in 2001. Eric Newby died in 2006.</p><h2>Connecting With Self and Others</h2><p>Life is a series of interpersonal exchanges-connections and disconnections-ranging from painful, distracting, and destructive encounters to joyful, meaningful, intimate and productive experiences.

But that's what happens when the children visit Alderley Edge, a&nbsp;spooky place in a remote part of England. There, they&nbsp;meet the wizard Cadellin, who needs the stone to rouse his allies in the never-ending battle between good and evil. But when the stone vanishes,&nbsp;Susan and Colin must find it before the forces of evil use it to destroy all the goodness that ever existed in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Includes an&nbsp;afterword by the author.</p><p>Readers who love E. Nesbit or Susan Cooper may discover a new favorite in Alan Garner, winner of many awards for literary excellence including the Carnegie Medal. <i>The Weirdstone of Brisingamen</i>, first published in 1960, is the story of two children, Susan and Colin, who are sent to rural England to stay with Bess Mossock, their mother's childhood nurse. The Mossocks' farm is delightfully old-fashioned, and the Alderley area is dotted with interesting woods to explore as well as treacherous disused mines. Susan and Colin encounter a frightening local woman, and feel they are being watched by crows. The air of menace quickly becomes acute danger as the children are pursued by small goblinlike beings, who truss them in cobwebby ropes. An ancient wizard named Cadellin comes to their rescue. As they learn more of the dark forces that threaten Alderley, Susan and Colin find themselves on the run through the abandoned mine tunnels, aided by a pair of heroic dwarfs. <p> Garner's knowledge of folklore and the Alderley area--his characters' dialect sounds realistic instead of like rote fantasy-speak--imbues his story with a thoughtful depth. His writing is as clear as poetry: "And they passed between the stones, only to stop short a couple of paces later, with despair in their hearts, cold as the east wind."

MY SWEET AUDRINA The house in the wood was picturesque and charming. The family who lived there were happy and affluent. So what was the secret of the room -- empty of everything but the rocking chair? Audrina wanted to be as good as her sister. Audrina knew her parents could not love her as they loved her sister. Her sister was perfect, much loved -- and dead. But how did she die? Who was Audrina and who did she have to become? What was the secret that everyone knew? Everyone except sweet Audrina! The haunting story of love and deceit, innocence and betrayal, and terrible family secrets.</p><p>Virginia Andrews lived in Norfolk, Virginia, studied art and worked as a fashion illustrator, commercial artist and portrait painter. Flowers in the Attic, based on a true story, was her first novel. It became an immediate bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic when it was first published in 1979. Virginia Andrews died in 1986, leaving a considerable amount of unpublished work.<b>Part 1: Whitefern</b><br><br>There was something strange about the house where I grew up. There were shadows in the corners and whispers on the stairs and time was as irrelevant as honesty. Though how I knew that I couldn't say.<br><br>There was a war going on in our house, a silent war that sounded no guns, and the bodies that fell were only wishes that died and the bullets were only words and the blood that spilled was always called pride.<br><br>Though I'd never been to school -- and I was seven years old and it was high time I was in school -- it seemed I knew all about the Civil War. Around me the Civil War was still being waged, and though the future might stretch ahead for billions of years, it was still the war we'd never forget, for our pride had been injured, and our passions were lingering on. We'd lost the battle better won by the opposite side. Maybe that's why it still kept hurting.<br><br>Momma and my aunt Ellsbeth always said that men liked violent discussions about wars better than any other topic, but if there were other wars of any importance at all, they were never discussed in our house. Papa would read any book, see any movie, cut out any magazine photo that represented that war between brothers, even though his ancestors had fought against my maternal ones. He was Yankee born, but a Southerner by preference. At the dinner table he'd recount the plots of the long novels he read about General Robert E. Lee and give grisly accounts of all the bloody battles. And if most of what he read charmed me, it did not charm either my aunt, who preferred the television, or my mother, who preferred to read her own books, claiming Papa left out the best parts, which weren't fit for young ears to hear.<br><br>That meant my ears, and my cousin Vera's ears. Though most of the world believed Vera to be my sister, I knew she was my unmarried aunt's illegitimate daughter -- and that we had to shield her from the scorn of society by pretending she was my legitimate older sister. I did have a legitimate older sister, too, but she had died before I was born. Her name was also Audrina, and even though she had been dead a long time, still she lingered on. My papa never forgot the first and best Audrina, and still hoped that someday I would be as special as she was.<br><br>My cousin Vera liked people to think she was my sister. I didn't know her true age, for she refused to tell me that. Nobody in our house ever revealed their ages. Only my age was talked about all the time. It was Vera's boast that she could be any age she wanted to be -- ten, twelve, fifteen, and even twenty. With a few elegant and sophisticated postures, truly she did change her manner and expression. She could look very mature -- or very childlike -- depending on her mood. She liked to ridicule me because I was so uncertain about time. Often Vera told me I'd hatched full blown from a giant ostrich egg at the age of seven. She always said that I had inherited that bird's famous habit of sticking its head in the sand and pretending nothing in the world was wrong. She didn't know about my dreams and the ugliness they gave me.<br><br>From the very beginning, I knew Vera was my enemy even when she pretended to be my friend. Though I wanted her for my friend in the worst way, I knew she hated me. She was jealous because I was an Audrina and she wasn't. Oh, how I wanted Vera to like and admire me, as sometimes I really liked and admired her. I envied her, too, because she was normal and didn't have to try to be like someone who was dead. No one seemed to care if Vera wasn't special. No one except Vera. Vera was fond of telling me that I wasn't really special, either, I was merely strange. To tell the truth, I thought there was something strange about me, too. I seemed to be unable to recall anything about my early childhood. I couldn't remember anything about the past -- what I had done the week or even the day before. I didn't know how I had learned the things I knew, or why I seemed to know some things I shouldn't.<br><br>The many clocks scattered throughout our giant house confused me even more. The grandfather clocks in the halls chimed out different hours; the cuckoos in their wooden Swiss clocks popped in and out of small ornate doors, each contradicting all the others; the fancy French clock in my parents' bedroom had stopped long ago at midnight or noon, and a Chinese clock ran backwards. To my great distress, though I searched everywhere, there were no calendars in our house, not even old ones. And the newspapers never came on the day they were due. Our only magazines were old ones, stacked in closets, hidden in the attic. Nobody threw anything away in our house. It was kept, saved for our descendents, so they could sell it one day and make a fortune.<br><br>Much of my insecurity had to do with the first Audrina, who had died exactly nine years before I was born. She had died mysteriously in the woods after cruel and heartless boys had spoiled her in some indescribable way, and because of her, I was never supposed to enter the woods, even to go to school. And the woods were all around us, almost smothering us. They embraced us on three sides, the River Lyle on the fourth. To go anywhere we had to travel through the woods.<br><br>Everywhere in our home photographs of the First and Best Audrina were scattered. On Papa's desk, there were three framed portraits of her, at age one, two and three. There was not one single baby picture of me, not one, and that hurt. The First Audrina had been a beautiful little girl, and when I looked at her photographs, I felt oddly haunted, wanting to be her so badly I ached inside. I wanted to be her so I'd feel as loved, as special as everyone said she had been; and then again, contrarily, I wanted more than anything to be myself, and on my own merits gain the love I felt denied me.<br><br>Oh, the tales Papa could tell me about the wonders of his first daughter, and everyone he told made me know I was not the Best Audrina, not the perfect and special one -- only the second and the inferior one.<br><br>My parents kept the first Audrina's bedroom like a shrine for a dead princess. It was left exactly as it had been on the day she met her fate, which was never explained in detail to me. That room was so full of toys it seemed more a playroom than a bedroom. Momma herself cleaned that room, and she hated housework. Just to see <i>her</i> room made me realize nothing had been too good for <i>her,</i> while my bedroom lacked toy shelves, and her vast array of playthings. I felt cheated, cheated of a real childhood. Audrina the First and Best had stolen my youth, and everyone talked so much about her that I couldn't remember anything about me. I believed it was because of her that my memory was so full of holes.<br><br>Papa would try to fill those holes by putting me in her rocking chair and making me rock and sing until I became "the empty pitcher that would fill with everything."<br><br>He wanted me to fill with her memories and capture her special powers since she was dead and didn't need them anymore.<br><br>And as if one ghost weren't enough, we had a second who came every Tuesday at four. "Teatime," we called Aunt Mercy Marie's day. There she'd sit on the piano, in her black and white photograph in a silver frame, her fat face beaming a vacuous smile, her pale blue eyes staring out as if she could see us, when she couldn't. She was dead, and yet undead, just like my dead sister.<br><br>My aunt and my mother would speak for Aunt Mercy Marie, and through her they would let loose all the venom they held back and saved for "teatimes." Strangely enough, my cousin Vera enjoyed these Tuesday teatimes so much she'd find any reason to play hookey from school, just to be there and hear all the ugly things my mother and her half sister could say to one another. They were Whitefern sisters, and once upon a far ago time, that had meant something wonderful. Now it meant something sad, but they would never tell me exactly what.<br><br>Long ago the Whitefern family had been the most notable family in our Tidewater section of Virginia, giving the country senators and vice presidents. But we'd fallen out of favor not just with the villagers, but also with everyone, and we were no longer honored, or even respected.<br><br>Our house was far from the nearest city of any size.<br><br>Whitefern Village was fifteen miles down a lonely country road, but we seldom went there. It was as if long ago some secret war had been declared, and we in our castle (as Papa liked to call our home) were hated by the "serfs" in the lowlands. If anyplace in our vicinity could be called "highlands" it was the slight hill on which Whitefern sat.<br><br>Papa had to drive thirty miles to and from his stockbrokerage office. All the friends we had lived in the city. Our nearest neighbors were twelve miles away as a car drove, five as a crow flew. Papa drove our only car to work, leaving all of us without transportation. So often my aunt Ellsbeth would bemoan the day she'd sold her small car to buy the TV set.<br><br>My aunt, who'd never been married, loved her portable television set with a twelve-inch screen. She seldom allowed me to watch, though her daughter, Vera, could watch as much as she liked when she was home from school. That was another thing I couldn't understand: why Vera was allowed to go to school when I couldn't go. School was dangerous for me, but not for Vera.<br><br>Naturally I presumed there had to be something terribly wrong with me. My parents had to hide me away to keep me safe, if not from outsiders, then from myself. That was the scariest thought of all.<br><br>At the age of seven, while other children boarded yellow buses and rode off giggling and having fun, I sat down at the kitchen table and was taught how to read, write, add and subtract by my mother, who played the piano beautifully but was not good at teaching anything but how to play the piano. Fortunately, or maybe not, my aunt Ellsbeth was there to help. She had once been a gradeschool teacher with ready slaps to deliver any boy who dared to call her a nasty name. Just one slap too many, and the parents had seen that my aunt was fired. Though she tried for many a year to find another teaching position, the word was out. My aunt had a ferocious temper and a ready hand.<br><br>Aunt Ellsbeth, like her daughter, Vera, also had ready comments to criticize our way of living. According to my aunt we were all as "antediluvian" as the house in which we lived. "Out of sync with the rest of the world," she'd say.<br><br>In my dreams of home, Whitefern loomed up high and white against a dark and stormy sky, frightening to behold. It threatened in the night, but in the day it welcomed me with open arms. I had a habit of sitting outside on the lawn and admiring the grandness of Whitefern. It was a gingerbread Victorian house of many frills, with its white paint peeling, its dark blinds loose and crooked. It had three stories, with an attic and a basement toward the back half of the house where the spacious lawn inclined toward the River Lyle. As I stared at that house, I thought I had much in common with it. We were both antediluvian and out of sync.<br><br>Our windows were myriad, many of them beautiful stained glass. The shutters, about to fall off, were so darkly red they appeared black from a distance, like dried blood. From the outside the most marvelous thing of all were the balustrades on all the many porches, balconies and verandas, designed to look like stylized woodferns.<br><br>In the very center of the dark roof was a round cupola with a copper roof now turned green from tarnish. It formed a point that was topped by a golden ball whose gold leaf was coming off bit by bit each time it rained.<br><br>The cupola was about fourteen feet in diameter, and every single one of its many windows was made of leaded stained glass with scenes to represent the angels of life and death.<br><br>Inside and out, ferns cascaded everywhere from wicker stands. There were other plants, but the ferns seemed to steal what moisture there was in the air so soon all other plants died.<br><br>On stealthy, timid feet I played my small lonely games in the great foyer where the stained glass from the double front doors threw colorful patterns on the floor. Rapier-sharp colors sometimes, stabbing into my brain and punching holes there. I also had little rhymes Vera had taught me that I said to protect myself from the colors:<br><br><i>Step on black, live forever in a shack.<br><br>Step on green, never be clean.<br><br>Step on blue, work will never be through.<br><br>Step on yellow, hear the world bellow.<br><br>Step on red, soon be dead.</i><br><br>Just so I wouldn't have to step on any color, I stole along near the walls, keeping to the shadows, listening to the clocks ticking away the wrong times and the silly cuckoos going crazy in the night. When the wind blew hard, the shutters banged and the floors creaked, the furnace in the basement coughed, sputtered, groaned, and the wind chimes in the cupola tinkled, tinkled.<br><br>Yet in the daytime there were things so wondrously grand in our house that I felt like Alice lost in a house of jewels. Art deco lamps and <i>objets d'art</i> were scattered hither and yon. Tiffany lamps rose up to throw more colors, to pattern the walls. Crystal prisms dangled from lamp shades, from wall sconces, from chandeliers, from gaslamps, catching colors, refracting rainbows that flashed like lightning whenever sunlight managed to steal through the lace curtains.<br><br>We had a fireplace in every room. There were eight of marble, many of elegantly carved wood and none were made of brick. Brick was not elegant enough for our type of house that seemed to despise simplicity.<br><br>Our ceilings were high, and carved with elaborate designs, making frames for Biblical or romantic scenes. In the olden days people had, or so it seemed to my young eyes, either too many clothes on, or too little that wanted to stay in place. I wondered why the Biblical scenes usually had more flesh showing than the ones where people were decidedly wicked. One could hardly believe those near-naked people were sincerely trying to follow where God would lead them.<br><br>Bare bosoms of impressive proportions protruded brazenly in every room of our house but mine. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and several other dead-eyed presidents gazed day after day at the naked lady lying on a chaise across the way as she forever dropped grapes into her gaping mouth. Naked baby boys flew about shamelessly shooting aimless arrows. But the men always modestly hid their maleness behind some strategically placed leaf or graceful flow of drapery. Women were not so apt to hide what they had, I'd often thought as I gazed at them. They looked shy, but acted bold. Aunt Ellsbeth had come up behind me once and explained bitterly that since most artists were men, it was only natural for them to delight in "exploiting" the nude female figure.<br><br>"Don't judge women by what you see in paintings and statues. Judge them only by what you yourself know about the women in your life. The day any man understands any woman will be the day the world comes to an end. Men are hateful, contrary creatures who say they want goddesses to put on pedestals. Once they have them up there, they rip off the halo, tear off the gown, slice off the wings so they can't fly and then kick the pedestal away so the woman falls at his feet and he can scream out as he kicks her, tramp! -- or worse."<br><br>To hear my aunt Ellsbeth talk one would think she'd been married a dozen or more times, and one thousand men had disappointed her. As far as I knew, only one man had.<br><br>Our furniture had many styles, all of them fancy. It seemed each chair, each table, each sofa, lamp, pillow, hassock, desk was in competition, trying to o...</p><h2>Mountains - Guide to Colorado Wildflowers Volume 2</h2><p>VOLUME 2 MOUNTAINS Confirm the names of old favorites and identify the myriad other wildflowers you&#39;ve seen while hiking the Colorado high country</p><p></p><h2>The Shelters of Stone (Earth&#39;s Children)</h2><p><b>The Shelters of Stone</b> opens as Ayla and Jondalar, along with their animal friends, Wolf, Whinney, and Racer, complete their epic journey across Europe and are greeted by Jondalar&#x2019;s people: the Zelandonii. The people of the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii fascinate Ayla. Their clothes, customs, artifacts, even their homes&#x2014;formed in great cliffs of vertical limestone&#x2014;are a source of wonder to her. And in the woman Zelandoni, the spiritual leader of the Ninth Cave <br>(and the one who initiated Jondalar into the Gift of Pleasure), she meets a fellow healer with whom to share her knowledge and skills.<br><br>But as Ayla and Jondalar prepare for the formal mating at the Summer Meeting, there are difficulties. Not all the Zelandonii are welcoming. Some fear Ayla&#x2019;s unfamiliar ways and abhor her relationship with those they call flatheads and she calls Clan. Some even oppose her mating with Jondalar, and make their displeasure known. Ayla has to call on all her skills, intelligence, knowledge, and instincts to find her way in this complicated society, to prepare for the birth of her child, and to decide whether she will accept new challenges and play a significant role in the destiny of the Zelandonii.<br><br>Jean Auel is at her very best in this superbly textured creation of a prehistoric society. <b>The Shelters of Stone</b> is a sweeping story of love and danger, with all the wonderful detail&#x2014;based on meticulous research&#x2014; that makes her novels unique. It is a triumphant continuation of the Earth&#x2019;s Children� saga that began with <b>The Clan of the Cave Bear</b>.

In <i>The Shelters of Stone</i>, Ayla meets the Zelandonii tribe of Jondalar, the Cro-Magnon hunk she rescued from Baby, her pet lion. Ayla is pregnant. How will Jondalar's mom react? Or his bitchy jilted fianc�e? Ayla wows her future in-laws by striking fire from flint and taming a wild wolf. But most regard her Neanderthal adoptive Clan as subhuman "flatheads." Clan larynxes can't quite manage language, and Ayla must convince the Zelandonii that Clan sign language isn't just arm-flapping. Zelandonii and Clan are skirmishing, and those who interbreed are deemed "abominations." What would Jondalar's tribe think if they knew Ayla had to abandon her half-breed son in Clan country? The plot is slow to unfold, because Auel's first goal is to pack the tale with period Pleistocene detail, provocative speculation, and bits of romance, sex, tribal politics, soap opera, and homicidal wooly rhino-hunting adventure. It's an enveloping fact-based fantasy, a genre-crossing time trip to the Ice Age. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>JEAN M. AUEL is an international phenomenon. Her books have sold 34 million copies worldwide.

Relates how Rome in her early years established herself in Italy, then engaged in conflict with Carthage, her most powerful neighbor and enemy, and finally extended her power all around the Mediterranean, giving to the world peace, law and order, and making unconsciously a highway both for Greek culture and for Christianity to spread to the West. Volume 3 in the 7-volume Streams of History series, which presents a vivid picture of the growth of Western Civilization from the early source of the historic stream back in the Nile, the Tigro-Euphrates and the Indus valleys, and then its widening and deepening as it moves westward. The series highlights the contributions of each culture to the stream of history and shows how its contributions are caught up and carried on to future peoples and nations. The student is led to see how each grows out of that which precedes, and shadows forth what follows, and that the discovery of America, and its subsequent institutional development was the fruitage of a seed which lay deep in the historic soul of Europe.

An antiquarian who knows many of the school&#39;s carefully guarded secrets, Fallon understands the powerful implications of the discovery. But as he delves into the school&#39;s past-from witch hangings to the fires of the Civil War to the riotous 1960s-he learns that men and women have risked death, disgrace, and banishment in pursuit of this invaluable relic. And, as he uncovers rifts between generations, families, friends, and lovers, Fallon begins to understand something else: that finding this landmark manuscript is a matter of life and death.</p><p>William Martin is the <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author of ten novels, an award-winning PBS documentary, and a cult classic horror movie, too. His first novel, <em>Back Bay</em>, introduced treasure hunting hero Peter Fallon, who has now appeared in five novels, and spent fourteen weeks on the Times list. SInce then Martin has been telling stories of the great and the anonymous in American history, from the Pilgrims to 9/11. His novels, including <em>Cape</em> <em>Cod, Annapolis, City of Dreams</em>, and <em>The Lincoln Letter</em>, have established him as "a storyteller whose smootness equals his ambition" (<em>Publisher's Weekly</em>). He lives near Boston with his wife and has three grown children. In 2005, he was the recipient of the prestigious New England Book Award, given to "an author whose body of work stands as a significant contribution to the culture of the region." <br><br>Martin continues to entertain with the successful formula he perfected in best-sellers <i>Back Bay </i>(1979) and <i>Cape Cod</i> (1991).<i> </i>The author races back and forth through time in order to solve a bookish mystery rooted in historical events. When antiquarian bookseller Peter Fallon follows the clues he hopes will lead him to recover a lost Shakespeare play written in the bard's own hand, he himself becomes the target of both underworld thugs and unscrupulous academics. The most compelling action takes place in the past as he traces the utterly fascinating evolution of Harvard University by interweaving it with the intimate history of one of New England's first families. Bound by oath to preserve John Harvard's library, Issac Wedge takes care to squirrel away the Shakespearean quarto the dying Harvard entrusted to his care. Realizing that Puritan reactionaries would most certainly destroy the play, Wedge hands it down for safekeeping to his own son, establishing a pattern that is repeated by each succeeding generation until it appears that the manuscript has been lost. Or has it? It is up to Fallon to put all the pieces of the puzzle together. The unexpected twists and turns through history will keep readers guessing and the pages turning. <i>Margaret Flanagan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

By the author of A Journal of the Plague Years.</p><p>De Beers Consolidated Mines is fighting for its life. The most powerful and secretive cartel in the world faces diamond smuggling in Angola, disruption in Russia, and a world-wide recession. But this is not the first emergency De Beers has confronted in its long history of struggle and survival. In The Last Empire, Stefan Kanfer chronicles the nineteenth-century diamond rush that transformed Johannes De Beer&#39;s humble South African farmstead into an exotic Klondike. With a scholar&#39;s precision and a novelist&#39;s eye, he recounts the rise of wild frontier towns like New Rush (now Kimberley) and Johannesburg, and their roisterous mix of plutocrats and prostitutes, gamblers and politicians. Kanfer shows the roots of the racial crisis in the developing land: the misery of black miners and the fortunes of white prospectors; the defeat of the African emperor Lobengula and the rise of his legendary adversary, Cecil Rhodes, who would rule both the Cape Colony and De Beers. In the twentieth century, the cartel comes under the control of the Oppenheimers, a German-Jewish dynasty that builds De Beers and its gold-mining twin, the Anglo American Corporation, into an empire of unmatched global reach, and creates a shadow government more flexible and powerful than South Africa&#39;s official leadership. Kanfer documents the Oppenheimers&#39; dealings on and under the table: their condemnation of apartheid even as they exploit cheap black labor, their quiet takeover of Salomon Brothers, their monopoly on diamonds and their grip on gold maintained at all costs and by any means. And he uncovers the passionate inside story of the billionaire family whose empire, he argues, will survive well into the twenty-firstcentury.From veteran Time editor Kanfer (A Summer World, 1989, etc.): an enjoyable history of De Beers, the great business empire that founded a country, helped start a war, and funded the legendary Rhodes scholarships. Kanfer begins with the discovery, in 1867, of the first diamond in South Africa, found by a farm boy who noticed ``in the glare of the sun a glittering pebble.'' That pebble was the first of a great mother lode of diamonds to be found in this arid area of South Africa along the Orange River and, later--to the great relief of investors--buried deep in the ground in pipes of ancient rock. The Kimberley diamond fields attracted adventurers, failures, and a slew of ambitious men: young Jews from the London slums, like Solly Joel and the great Barney Barnato; Albert Beit, from Germany; and, of course, Cecil Rhodes, the clergyman's son who dreamed of making the continent British from the Cape to Cairo. Kanfer describes how these men formed the holdings that--named after the owners of a farm on which a rich lode was discovered--became De Beers. In time, the old guard was taken over by Ernest Oppenheimer, an ambitious young Englishman who survived anti-Semitism, the obstructions of rivals, even a shipwreck, to found--with the help of American capital--the Anglo American Corporation, which he used to buy De Beers, turning it into a powerful cartel that today controls the worldwide sale of diamonds. Kanfer not only details the Oppenheimers' rise to fame and fortune, their often brilliant tactics to safeguard their empire (not the least being the slogan ``a diamond is forever''), and the relevant historical background, but he also speculates on a future threatened by turmoil in South Africa, smuggling in Angola, disruption in Russia, and a global recession. Timely corporate history--as exciting and poignant as any good tale of derring-do against great odds by all-too-flawed giants. (Forty photographs) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This new tale finds Rostnikov trying to save a young circus aerialist from the killer of her two fellow performers. The inspector himself is like an acrobat on the high wire without a net, a target of both his jealous supervisor and the unknown murderer. Working day and night, Rostnikov nonetheless assumes the added burden of helping his colleague, Karpo, catch the mad knifer of eight prostitutes. The inspector also foils a plot by a Soviet official who threatens Rostnikov's young policeman friend, Tkach, before this witty, intricate thriller reaches a suspenseful finale in the center ring under the Moscow Circus Big Top. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Peachtree Road</h2><p>Two star-crossed cousins, the independent Lucy and the bookish Shep, play out a love-hate relationship over several decades among the elite levels of Southern society</p><p>Headstrong, exuberant, and independent, Lucy Bondurant is a devastating beauty who will never become the demure Southern lady her mother and society demand.

Toklas includes an introduction by Thomas Fensch in Penguin Modern Classics. For Gertrude Stein and her wife Alice B. Toklas, life in Paris was based upon the rue de Fleurus and the Saturday evenings and &#39;it was like a kaleidoscope slowly turning&#39;. Picasso was there with &#39;his high whinnying Spanish giggle&#39;, as were Cezanne and Matisse, Hemingway and Fitzgerald. As Toklas put it - &#39;The geniuses came and talked to Gertrude Stein and the wives sat with me&#39;. A light-hearted entertainment, this is in fact Gertrude Stein&#39;s own autobiography and a roll-call of all the extraordinary painters and writers she met between 1903 and 1932. Audacious, sardonic and characteristically self-confident, this is a definitive account by American in Paris. Gertrude Stein (1874-1946), a writer of experimental prose, is one of the original American Modernists. Born in Pennsylvania, she lived most of her life in Paris with her partner, Alice B. Toklas. Experimental books like Three Lives (1909), Tender Buttons (1914), and The Making of Americans (1925) established her reputation as an avant-garde stylist, and The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas made her an international celebrity. As an experimental writer she has been an inspiration to countless novelists and poets in our century, from Ernest Hemingway and Edith Sitwell in her own time to Jack Kerouac and Robert Duncan in ours. If you enjoyed The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, you might like Virginia Woolf&#39;s Orlando, also available in Penguin Modern Classics. &#39;Buttonholes the reader with its informality, its unhurried rhythms, deadpan humour and acerbic remarks&#39; Frances Spalding, Sunday Times</p><p>Largely to amuse herself, Gertrude Stein wrote this book in 1932..using as a sounding board her companion Miss Toklas, who had been with her for twenty-five years. The book is full of the most lucid and shapely anecdotes, told in a purer and more closely fitting prose...than even Gide or Hemingway have ever commanded.Stein&#39;s most famous work; one of the richest and most irreverent biographies ever written.</p><h2>An Experiment in Leisure</h2><p><p>What is it that stops people from knowing what they want? How often do we wonder where we are going and what our world is all about?</p> <p></p> <p>Written in 1936 as a companion piece to <em>A Life of One&#x2019;s Own</em>, <em>&nbsp;An Experiment in Leisure</em> further charts Marion Milner&#x2019;s illuminating and rewarding investigation into how we lead our lives. Instead of drawing on her daily diary, she turns to memory images &#x2013; images not only from her own life but also from books, mythology, travel and religion that seem to point to a suspension of ordinary, everyday awareness. From this condition of emptiness springs an increasing imaginative appreciation both of being alive and of the world we live in.</p> <p></p> <p>With a new introduction by Maud Ellmann, <em>An Experiment in Leisure</em> remains a great adventure in thinking and living and will be essential reading for all those from a literary, an artistic, a historical, an educational or a psychoanalytic/psychotherapeutic background.</p></p><p><p><strong>Marion Milner</strong> (1900-1998) was a distinguished British psychoanalyst, educationalist, autobiographer and artist.</p><p><em>"What does a woman want?</em> <em>"What is revolutionary [...] is that the author makes herself the subject rather than the object of Freud&#x2019;s notoriously chauvinistic question. Aware that her own wants have been distorted and obscured by expectations about &#x2018;woman&#x2019; and the pressure to subordinate a woman&#x2019;s wants to those of others, she strives to develop &#x2018;a method for discovering one&#x2019;s true likes and dislikes, for finding and setting up a standard of values that is truly one&#x2019;s own and not a borrowed mass-produced ideal.&#x2019;" -</em> <strong>Maud Ellmann, from the New Introduction</strong></p></p><h2>The Lighthouse Stevensons</h2><p><p>For centuries the seas around Scotland were notorious for shipwrecks.&nbsp;Mariners' only aids were skill, luck, and single coal-fire light on the east coast, which was usually extinguished by rain.&nbsp;In 1786 the Northern Lighthouse Trust was established, with Robert Stevenson appointed as chief engineer a few years later.&nbsp;In this engrossing book, Bella Bathhurst reveals that the Stevensons not only supervised the construction of the lighthouses under often desperate conditions but also perfected a design of precisely chiseled interlocking granite blocks that would withstand the enormous waves that batter these stone pillars.&nbsp;The same Stevensons also developed the lamps and lenses of the lights themselves, which "sent a gleam across the wave" and prevented countless ships from being lost at sea.</p><p>While it is the writing of Robert Louis Stevenson that brought fame to the family name, this mesmerizing account shows how his extraordinary&nbsp;ancestors changed the shape of the Scotland coast against incredible odds and with remarkable technical ingenuity.</p></p><p><blockquote><i>"Whenever I smell salt water, I know that I am not far from one of the works of my ancestors."</i> --Robert Louis Stevenson </blockquote> The 14 lighthouses dotting the Scottish coast were all built by the same family that produced Robert Louis Stevenson, Scotland's most famous novelist. Surprised? Bella Bathurst throws a powerful, revolving light into the darkness of this historical tradition. Robert Louis was a sickly fellow, and--unlike the rest of his strong-willed, determined family--certainly not up to the astonishing rigors of lighthouse building, which is vividly described here. Constructing these towering structures in the most inhospitable places imaginable (such as the aptly named Cape Wrath), using only 19th-century technology, is an achievement that beggars belief. One thinks of the pyramid building of ancient Egypt. At the Skerryvore lighthouse, the ground rocks were prepared by hand (even though the "gneiss could blunt a pick in three blows") in waves and winds "strong enough to lift a man bodily off the rock" and that "it took 120 hours to dress a single stone for the outside of the tower, and 320 hours to dress one of the central stones. In total 5000 tons of stone were quarried and shipped"--and all by hand. It is mind-boggling stuff: you'll look at lighthouses with a new respect. <i>--Adam Roberts, Amazon.co.uk</i>Bella Bathurst is a freelance journalist.

Now the talented author of <b>Dreaming of the Bones</b> returns with another darkly irresistible tale, this one leading Kincaid and James into their most haunting inquiry ever.<br><br>The call from Scotland Yard couldn't have come at a worse time for Duncan Kincaid. He has promised the weekend to Kit, the eleven-year-old son of his ex-wife. The son he never knew he fathered--who doesn't yet know Kincaid's true identity. But Duncan's best intentions are shattered by a case that draws him in and consumes his interest.<br><br>A young woman's body has been found in the tall grass of East London's Mudchute Park, her jacket and short skirt carefully arranged to preserve her modesty. It seems too odd a detail for a simple case of robbery or assault gone awry. And indeed the case becomes more complex when the dead woman is identified as Annabelle Hammond, bold and brilliant head of a family-owned tea company. For the victim was a mystery even to those who knew her best. <br><br>Alluring, headstrong, and ambitious, with looks no man could forget, Annabelle was the sort of woman who inspired the strongest of emotions...passion certainly, jealousy, anger, even obsession. And when Duncan and Gemma fan out to question anyone connected to her, it doesn't take long to discover that the lady was also adept at keeping secrets...especially from those she loved.<br><br>As the detectives try to penetrate Annabelle's tangled affairs to glean the motive of her killer, their list of suspects grows to include her suave, upper-class fianc�; the handsome street musician who may have been the last person to see her alive; her sister's vengeful ex-husband; even her own father. But what they don't know is that this case has long roots that reach far back into the past, and that resentments that should have been long buried still have the power to hurt, and maybe even the capacity to kill.</p><p>Nominated for an Edgar, Deborah Crombie's 1997 <i>Dreaming of the Bones</i> was such a triumph in all respects that it's a hard act to follow. <i>Kissed a Sad Goodbye</i>, Crombie's sixth book about Scotland Yard's Duncan Kincaid and Gemma James, isn't quite as spectacular as her previous rendition. Still, the author who creates her very British world from a town in North Texas has managed to come up with an entirely respectable and highly enjoyable effort. Her story offers a fascinating setting in place of the poignant, personal drama that invigorated <i>Dreaming of the Bones</i>.<p> The body of a lovely young woman is found in London's fashionable Docklands area. She turns out to be Annabelle Hammond, the director of an old family firm of tea merchants. She was a woman of tremendous talent and sexual appetite, but also the kind of harsh and abrasive personality that provides plenty of motives for murder. The Hammond family is also historically linked to the self-made property developer Lewis Finch and his son, an activist dropout and street musician. The other suspects include a spineless boyfriend who works at the tea firm, a secretary too loyal to be true, and herrings of various shades of crimson. Kincaid and James have to solve it all, even as their own personal problems threaten to intrude. Thanks to Crombie's enviable ability to bring people and places to life with a single phrase, the story zips along like the new Docklands electric railroad.</p><p> Previous Kincaid-James books in paperback include <i>Dreaming of the Bones</i>, <i>All Shall Be Well</i>, <i>Leave the Grave Green</i>, and <i>Mourn Not Your Dead</i>. <i>--Dick Adler</i></p>Highest praise for Deborah Crombie:<p><i>Dreaming of the Bones</i>, a New York Times Notable Book of the Year and winner of the Macavity Award and nominated for the Edgar and the Agatha Awards for the Year's Best Novel:</p><p>"Fascinating...multilayered."<br>--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"A story of death, obsession and secrets."<br>--<i>Houston Chronicle</i></p><p>"Dreaming of the Bones will make you cry and <br>catch your breath in surprise."<br>--<i>Chicago Tribune</i></p><p><i>Mourn Not Your Dead</i>:</p><p>"Finely tuned...

He and his friends joined the U.S. Marine Corps in 1940 and after training he was posted to the U.S.S. Houston.<br><br>At first, assignments in Hawaii, Guam and the Philippines&#x2014;whilst instructing him in the rough and tumble of crew life&#x2014;were free of encounters with the enemy. But then in 1942 the Houston was first attacked during the battle of the Flores Sea and subsequently sunk by the Japanese fleet during the battle of the Java Sea. Witnessing the last moments of the great ship, Gee survived a prolonged period in the sea clinging to a makeshift raft, before being picked up by a Japanese ship. But this was just the beginning of his ordeal.<br><br>Initially held prisoner in Java and forced to load and unload enemy ships, he was then transferred to Burma where he worked on the notorious &#x201c;death railway,&#x201d; living on the banks of the River Kwai. Those who survived the hard labor and harsh conditions there would be sent on to Thailand, then Singapore before arriving in Japan in 1945. There, they spent the last few months of the war working in coal mines just 40 miles outside Nagasaki. The dire circumstances of Gee&#x2019;s incarceration were only overcome through the compassion and companionship of fellow detainees and his determination to endure.<br><br>After his liberation, he was sent to Guantanamo Bay Naval Hospital, Cuba. There, he encountered Rosalie Hamric Smith R.N., who was serving as Charge Nurse in the Psychiatric Ward, and who helped him to record his experiences as part of his treatment. Rosalie worked his accounts into a manuscript which, following her sudden death, languished in an attic for over thirty years.

Through a series of four "conversations," he translates the context of Aquinas's spiritual theology into popular language. The dialogs center on the four paths within creation spirituality: Via Positiva (awe and wonderment), Via Negativa (silence and darkness), Via Creativa (imagination and creativity), and Via Transformativa (compassion). Fox uses the writings of Aquinas to provide a dialog that brings forth a positive guide to spiritual growth. Instead of the "fire and brimstone" approach to salvation, the reader is exposed to the path of cosmological spirituality. Recommended for large public and academic libraries.<br><i>- L.

As Cardinal Ratzinger he was the closest Vatican prelate to John Paul II, working together with him for almost 25 years in the Vatican. When John Paul died, the world saw Cardinal Ratzinger speak so beautifully and eloquently at the pope&#39;s funeral, then at the Mass preceeding the Papal Conclave. Soon afterwards, the College of Cardinals quickly elected Ratzinger as John Paul&#39;s successor. This book unites these two great spiritual leaders in one powerful, deeply moving volume, complete with over 100 pages of truly inspiring, unique photos by Vatican photographer Giancarlo Giuliani (many never before published) of many striking and poignant moments of the pontificate of John Paul II as he traveled around the world. Ratzinger shares his many personal experiences and insights about this pontificate that changed the world. Illustrated.</p><p><p><b>Joseph Ratzinger</b> (Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI)&nbsp;is recognized as one of the most brilliant theologians and spiritual leaders of our age. As pope he authored the best-selling&nbsp;<i>Jesus of Nazareth</i>. Prior to his pontificate, he wrote many influential books important for the contemporary Church, such as &nbsp;<i>Introduction to Christianity&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The Spirit of the Liturgy.</i></p>Filled with images taken by photojournalist Giuliani, this tribute to the late Pope John Paul II is destined for display on well-appointed Catholic coffee tables. Accompanied by text from John Paul himself; the new pope, Benedict XVI; and Leonardo Zega of <i>Famiglia Cristiana</i> magazine, the book cycles through the late pontiff's 26-year reign, calling particular attention to his extensive travels, which are listed along with his encyclicals and a chronology of his life. The photographs showing John Paul embracing children and at worship are among the most powerful in the collection. Other captivating images include one of the pope looking like a tribal leader in fringed vestments as he emerges from an Indian tent during a 1987 visit to Canada, and another of him sporting a construction worker's hardhat on a 1988 trip to Bolivia. Giuliani's photographs, many of which are being published for the first time, also capture the late pontiff at work, in meetings with world leaders and in vulnerable moments like the 1981 attempt on his life. Pope Benedict's contribution comprises reflections written at the 10-year and 20-year marks of John Paul's papacy and the homily he delivered at the pope's funeral. John Paul's charismatic appeal should make this visual memoir popular among Catholic readers. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Tracing the critical debate over communism and modernism, he surveys the writers who were in the forefront of that debate and the issues that animated their criticism and controversies. An honest, unsparing, and often devastating analysis. &#x2014;Kirkus Reviews</p><p>Hilton Kramer is editor of <i>The New Criterion</i> and author of <i>The Age of the Avant-Garde</i> and <i>The Revenge of the Philistines</i>. He is also art critic of the <i>New York Observer</i>.An honest, unsparing, and often devastating analysis of how the intellectuals of the leftand for much of the last 70 years the term `intellectual' was almost synonymous with the leftdealt with the supreme moral conflict of our times, that between communism and democracy. Kramer (The Revenge of the Philistines: Art and Culture 19721984, 1985), editor of the New Criterion, calls the Cold War ``as much a war of ideas as it was a contest for military superiority'' and writes bluntly that ``many talented people in the West . . . fought on the side of the political enemy.'' The evidence is presented in a series of essays written over the last 25 years, mostly dealing with individuals, of whom the Americans cause him the greatest anguish: those, for example, who condemned Whittaker Chambers, who at great personal cost revealed the part he had played in a Communist spy ring, rather than Alger Hiss, who in the face of increasingly incontrovertible evidence denied any role; the left in Hollywood, epitomized by John Huston, in Hollywood on Trial, who averred that in 1946 ``Winston Churchill drew an iron curtain across Eastern Europe''; the radicals of the '60s who likened Amerika to Nazi Germany; Mary McCarthy, who in Hanoi praised the virtuous tyranny of the regime and castigated both the American prisoners-of-war and America itself; and George Steiner, who attacked Solzhenitsyn for the moral indecency of implying that Soviet terror was as hideous as Hitlerism. Kramer does not, however, adduce evidence in this book for his much more far-reaching assertion that, as an intellectual tradition, liberalism is bankrupt and that it has surrendered to socialist ideology. Nor does he do much to link the decline in the fortunes of Marxism with that of modernism, his other theme. The Cold War was a war, and Kramer is scarred, but few fought it with more honor, consistency, and moral passion. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

As commander he never lost a battle. Yet it is his adversary, Hannibal, who has lived on in the public memory, due mostly to his daring march through the Alps with his elephants. At the Battle of the Ticinus, Hannibal� s initial encounter with Roman arms, young Scipio first tasted warfare, rescuing his dangerously wounded, encircled father, who was also the Roman commander. By nineteen Scipio was the equivalent of a staff colonel and in 210 B.C. he was placed in supreme command. In three years he destroyed Carthaginian power in Spain and, after being made consul, took his forces to Africa, where he conquered Carthage� s great ally, Syphax. Two years later he clashed with Hannibal himself, annihilating his army in the decisive Battle of Zama. For this triumph and his other exploits in the Punic Wars, Scipio was awarded the title Africanus.In his fascinating portrait of this extraordinary commander, B. H. Liddell Hart writes, � The age of generalship does not age, and it is because Scipio� s battles are richer in stratagems and ruses many still feasible today than those of any other commander in history that they are an unfailing object lesson.� Not only military enthusiasts and historians but all those interested in outstanding men will find this magnificent study absorbing and gripping.</p><p>Born on 31 October 1895, Sir Basil Henry Liddell Hart, commonly known throughout most of his career as Captain B.H. Liddell Hart, was a British soldier, military historian and military theorist who was known for his advocacy of mechanized warfare. Having enlisted in the Army in 1914, Liddell Hart served on the Western Front, being wounded on a number of occasions. Participating in the Battle of the Somme, he was hit three times without serious injury before being badly gassed and sent out of the line on 19 July 1916.

Drawing parallels between Jesus and the Buddha--and the rich traditions from which they hail--His Holiness delivers a profound affirmation of the sacred in all religions. Readers will be inspired by the Dalai Lama&#39;s discussion of the endless merits of each tradition and uplifted by the common humanity between them.</p><p>Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, is the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. Born in northeastern Tibet in 1935, he was as a toddler recognized as the incarnation of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and brought to Tibet's capital, Lhasa. In 1950, Mao Zedong's Communist forces made their first incursions into eastern Tibet, shortly after which the young Dalai Lama assumed the political leadership of his country. In 1959, Chinese forces occupied the city, forcing His Holiness to escape to India. There he set up the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, working to secure the welfare of the more than 100,000 Tibetan exiles and prevent the destruction of Tibetan culture. In his capacity as a spiritual and political leader, he has traveled to more than sixty-two countries on six continents and met with presidents, popes, and leading scientists to foster dialogue and create a better world. In recognition of his tireless work for the nonviolent liberation of Tibet, the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. In 2012, he relinquished political authority in his exile government and turned it over to democratically elected representatives. He is the author of numerous books, including <i>The Good Heart</i>, <i>The Meaning of Life</i>, <i>The World of Tibetan Buddhism</i>, and <i>The Compassionate Life</i>.<br><br>Dom Laurence Freeman, OSB, is spiritual head of the World Community for Christian Meditation.<br><br>Thupten Jinpa Langri was educated in the classical Tibetan monastic academia and received the highest academic degree of Geshe Lharam (equivalent to a doctorate in divinity). Jinpa also holds a BA in philosophy and a PhD in religious studies, both from the University of Cambridge, England. Since 1985, he has been the principal English-language translator to the Dalai Lama. He has translated and edited many books by the Dalai Lama, including<i> The World of Tibetan Buddhism</i>, <i>Essence of the Heart Sutra</i>, and <i>Ethics for the New</i> <i>Millennium</i>. Jinpa has published scholarly articles on various aspects of Tibetan culture, Buddhism, and philosophy, and books such as <i>Songs of Spiritual Experience</i> (co-authored) and <i>Self, Reality and Reason in Tibetan </i>Thought.

We look at an old building and ask ourselves, "What on earth were those people thinking of?"</b></i>--Witold Rybczynski, <i>The Look of Architecture</i>7If you were on an architectural tour of, say, Saint Peter's Square in Rome, maybe your tour guide would say something like, "This is a true example of Italian baroque--one of Giovanni Lorenzo Bernini's finest" in the lilting tone that many tour guides have. Then, while telling you how the architect was inspired to design such a masterpiece, he or she might slip in a genteel pun, one certain to be a cut above the if-it-ain't-baroque-don't-fix-it variety that you might hear and chuckle at out of pity back home.We brought that up for two reasons: (1) A fantasy writer like Terry Pratchett is an architect of sorts, but on a much grander scale than an Italian baroque master like Bernini or his rival, Francesco Borromini. After all, he had a whole world to design. Bernini and Borromini only had to influence Italy and several generations of would-be architects. (2) In this chapter, we're about to take you on an architectural tour of the Discworld, but one without the lilting tone or even remarks (at least not many remarks) about the <i>actual</i> architecture, such as Unseen University. (You would've bought <i>The Discworld Mapp</i> or <i>The Streets of Ankh-Morpork</i> for that, wouldn't you?) Instead, we'll discuss words--the building blocks of Discworld. Like the furniture in the office of Ladislav Pelc, the Professor of Morbid Bibliomancy in <i>Going Postal,</i> Discworld is a world designed out of books. It is a veritable library of literary allusions. By the end of the tour, you might feel like A. Clarence Shandon in <i>Silverlock</i> by John Myers Myers--as if you've walked through literary history.And since we're discussing Discworld, where characters named Flatulus (the god of winds, of course) abide, we'll throw in puns for free. Let's get write to it, shall we? (Feel free to ask questions while on the tour. We'll do our best to answer them. No question is considered dumb.)Since this is not a short chapter, maybe you should send out for pizza. We like pepperoni ... .<b>DISCLAIMER (or in honor of Discworld, Disc-Claimer):</b>This tour is by no means exhaustive. You might easily think of some aspects or allusions not noted here. We won't hold that against you.Like any good architect's, Pratchett's work should be judged by whether it fulfills the three purposes of good architecture, namely: (1) to shelter people; (2) to be durable against the elements andgravity; (3) to be beautiful or delightful.8 Judging by the millions of fans, shelves of books written over decades, awards, and several Discworld conventions (the first North American one coming in 2009!), we would venture to say that Discworld fulfilled all three.If you read <i>Strata,</i> you caught the gleam of Discworld in Pratchett's eye. But if you read <i>Ringworld</i> by Larry Niven, you caught the inspiration for that gleam. After all, <i>Strata</i> is considered a parody of <i>Ringworld,</i> Niven's 1970 sci-fi classic detailing the discovery of a 600-million-mile, ring-shaped world by an intrepid, eclectic collection of explorers. (In comparison, the Disc is only 10,000 miles wide.)9But the world beginning with <i>The Color of Magic</i> didn't just spring into being in 1983, or two years previous to that when <i>Strata</i> appeared, or even when <i>Ringworld</i> was read. If you look even further back, you'll find other elements that went into the blueprint of Discworld. There's a little bit of this and that in Pratchett's design.<b>INSPIRATION FROM THE PAST</b><i><b>Throughout our history we have clung to elements of our past as carriers of our culture ... . Where we can, we need to preserve its triumphs and occasionally its follies, the best and even sometimes the mundane examples of how our society lived, worked, worshiped, and played.</b></i>--John George Vanderbilt Henry Spencer-Churchill10An architect can look at an old building, with its crenellations or cornices, its Gothic or baroque style, and find inspiration to designsomething new to wow a twenty-first-century population. Or he or she, for the love of a particular time period (say, the 1920s), might design a building to revive a style of the past.Terry Pratchett looked at several old myths and was inspired to create Discworld.<b>Greek, Roman, and Norse Mythology: Pratchett Mines the Myths</b>Pick any of the Discworld books at random and you'll soon know that Terry Pratchett is very familiar with Greek, Roman, Norse, and Celtic mythology. Go on. We dare you. First, look at the Disc itself. In the world of Norse mythology, Earth is a flat disc in the branches of a tree called Yggdrasil. (Not a name you'd stick on a baby these days.) In Pratchett's world, the earth is a flat disc mounted on the backs of four elephants standing on a humongous turtle traveling through the multiverse (rather than the universe). That turtle is based on a myth he read as a child. More on that myth later.Second, check out the population. As you remember from high school or even middle school if you went to a fancy one, in Greek and Roman mythology, there are creatures like centaurs, fauns, satyrs, naiads, dryads, nymphs. But intervening or interfering in their lives are gods/goddesses such as Zeus, Hera, Minerva/Athena, Ares, and so on, who live on Mount Olympus. (Yeah, yeah. Like in the old <i>Xena: Warrior Princess</i> and <i>Hercules: The Legendary Journey</i> shows.) In Norse mythology, the gods/goddesses Odin, Thor, Eir, and so on live in Valhalla. Let's begin our population examination (it won't hurt) with the Discworld pantheon.&nbsp;<br><i><b>The Gods Must Be Crazy.</b></i> In the pantheon of Discworld, there's a smidgen of Greek and Roman mythology, plus a smattering of Norse as well. Instead of the two-eyed chief god Zeus (Jupiter inRoman mythology); Thor, the Norse thunder god; or even Thor's father, Odin, the one-eyed chief of the Aesir gods in Norse mythology, Blind Io, the thunder god, is the chief of the Discworld gods. Instead of Bacchus, the Greek god of wine, there's Bibulous, the god of wine and things on sticks. Instead of Loki, the trickster god kicked out of Valhalla, there's Hoki the Jokester. Instead of Aphrodite/Venus, the goddess of love, there's Astoria (like the hotel). And who can forget Pratchett's Fedecks--the messenger of the gods? ("When it absolutely has to be there overnight," as a FedEx advertising slogan proclaimed.) He can give Hermes, the messenger god (Mercury in Roman mythology), a run for his money. And of course, Discworld has minor deities similar to those in Greek and Roman mythology: Vulcan (the Greek Vulcan) and Hephaistos (the Greek Hephaestus).Pratchett includes unique gods and goddesses as well, like Anoia, the minor goddess of things that stick in drawers (and also lost corkscrews and things that roll under furniture), and Aniger, the goddess of squashed animals. (She must work overtime.)Although we said we wouldn't talk about architecture, we can't help mentioning one place--Dunmanifestin, the place where the gods apparently were <i>done manifesting.</i> In <i>The Last Hero,</i> Ghengiz Cohen (a.k.a. Cohen the Barbarian with a bit of Genghis Khan, the Mongolian conqueror of the thirteenth century) and his posse, the Silver Horde, argue with the Valkyries who want to take them to the Halls of the Slain in Dunmanifestin on Cori Celesti. Well, Dunmanifestin is referred to as "the stuccoed Valhalla" in <i>Guards! Guards!</i>11 (The Valkyries, the female warriors who take the dead to Valhalla, come from Norse mythology.)According to <i>Fairies and How to Avoid Them</i> by Miss Perspicacia Tick (a book mentioned in <i>Hat Full of Sky</i>), the Nac Mac Feegles believe that Earth is like Valhalla.&nbsp;<br><i><b>Other Stories (But the Gods Are in Them, Too).</b></i> Not content to tweak just the gods of Greek myths, Pratchett tweaks other people or their situations to include in Discworld. For example, you know the story of King Midas, right? An allusion to the greedy king's story appears early in <i>Witches Abroad,</i> which seems to be a veritable "<i>glod</i>mine" of allusions. Instead of King Midas, there is Seriph Al-Ybi, whose curse by a god with poor spelling causes everything he touches to turn to a dwarf named Glod.And how about the story of Daedalus and Icarus? It gets a send-up in <i>Jingo</i> and <i>The Last Hero.</i> Leonard of Quirm, Pratchett's answer to Leonardo da Vinci (more on them in chapter 19), has a similar goal of perfecting the art of flying, but not airline food.And of course, there is the story of Prometheus, the Titan and creator of man (according to the Greek myth) who dared to steal fire from the gods and suffered for it by having his liver eaten by an eagle every day. (But not with bacon or onions.) He's Mazda in Discworld and his theft is the inspiration for <i>The Last Hero,</i> where Ghengiz Cohen and the Silver Horde try to return fire to the gods by blowing them up. (A weird way of saying thanks. Flowers would've been better.)At this point, we have to mention another place--the Underworld, or realm of the dead. The Greeks and Romans had it in their mythology. This kingdom is ruled by Hades and surrounded by rivers that include Acheron, Styx, and Lethe. A three-headed dog named Cerberus guards this realm.Discworld not only has an Underworld, it has an infern...</p><h2>Needle Lace &amp; Needleweaving: A New Look at Traditional Stitches</h2><p>This compendium brings together over 60 traditional stitches for both needlelace and needleweaving, all detailed in step-by-step diagrams.</p><p></p><h2>Louis Kahn: Conversations with Students (Architecture at Rice)</h2><p>Louis Kahn (1901-74) is one of the most renowned practitioners of international modernism, on a par with Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe in the extent of his influence on subsequent generations of architects. Kahn sought the spiritual in his powerful forms, and encouraged his students to seek the essential nature of architecture. His Philadelphia-based practice was responsible for such masterpieces as the Richards Medical Research building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the Yale Art Gallery extension in New Haven, Connecticut; the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas; the government complex at Dhaka, Bangladesh; and the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California.<br>This title, in the same format as our highly successful <i>Rem Koolhaas: Conversations with Students</i>, contains a little-known essay by Kahn on his sources of inspiration, an interview with the architect on his working methods and his vision for the future of the profession, and writings on Kahn by Michael Bell and Lars Lerup, contributors to our title Stanley Saitowitz. <br><i>Louis Kahn: Conversations with Students</i> is the latest title in the series from the Rice University School of Architecture.</p><p>It is possible to admire without reservation Kahn's moving and pellucid architecture, but to be less enthusiastic about his sometimes recondite lectures and writings. On the other hand, every new insight into the great man's thinking about design should be welcome. This attractive little book offers a lecture, "White Light, Black Shadow," previously published in a 1986 anthology edited by Richard Saul Wurman, a questions-and-answer session with Rice University architecture students, and appreciations of Kahn by Lars Lerup and Michael Bell. -- <i>Interior Design</i></p><h2>Summer and Winter: A Weave for All Seasons</h2><p>Summer and winter is a traditional American weave structure, best knows for its use in some of the blue and white Early American coverlets.

Her 1956 novel Beast in View won the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Novel. In 1965 Millar was the recipient of the Los Angeles Times Woman of the Year Award and in 1983 the Mystery Writers of America awarded her the Grand Master Award for Lifetime Achievement.

Named after the migrant workers of America's Dust Bowl, these novels convey Blish's "history of the future," a brilliant and bleak look at a world where cities roam the Galaxy looking for work and a sustainable way of life. <br><br>In the first novel, <i>They Shall Have Stars</i>, man has thoroughly explored the Solar System, yet the dream of going even further seems to have died in all but one man. His battle to realize his dream results in two momentous discoveries anti-gravity and the secret of immortality. In <i>A Life for the Stars</i>, it is centuries later and antigravity generations have enabled whole cities to lift off the surface of the earth to become galactic wanderers. In <i>Earthman, Come Home</i>, the nomadic cities revert to barbarism and marauding rogue cities begin to pose a threat to all civilized worlds. In the final novel, <i>The Triumph of Time</i>, historyrepeats itself as the cities once again journey back in to space making a terrifying discovery which could destroy the entire Universe. A serious andhaunting vision of our world and its limits, <i>Cities in Flight</i> marks the return to print of one of science fiction's most inimitable writers. <br><br>A Selection of the Science Fiction Book Club</p><p><i>Cities in Flight</i> is an omnibus volume of four novels, originally published between 1955 and 1962, two of which are fix-ups of pieces that first appeared in various magazines in the early '50s. Despite having been conceived more than 50 years ago, and produced in episodic fashion, they stand head and shoulders above most SF available today.<p> In <i>They Shall Have Stars</i>, humankind's will to explore space is renewed with the advent of two discoveries: anti-gravity (the "spindizzy" machines) and the key to almost eternal life (anti-agathic drugs). By <i>A Life for the Stars</i>, centuries have passed and most of the major cities have built spindizzies into their bedrock and left earth, cruising the galaxy looking for work, much like the hobos of the Depression Era. <i>Earthman, Come Home</i>, told from the perspective of John Amalfi, the major of New York, was the first-written of the novels and--although not as tightly woven as the other segments--is still a masterly work. Blish gives the same weight and authority both to the sweeping cultural change wrought and suffered by the cities, and to the emotional growth of a man who is several hundred years old. We stay with Amalfi for the final episode, <i>The Triumph of Time</i>. New York is now planet-bound in the Greater Magellanic Cloud, but when Amalfi learns of the impending destruction of time itself, he is forced into space one more time, to take a last, desperate chance. The novel ends, literally, with a bang.</p><p> Despite the occasional, inevitable anachronism, such as vacuum tubes, <i>Cities in Flight</i> stands up remarkably well to modern reading. The novel's political and literary sophistication was unmatched in its time; there is very little to rival it even today. For most readers of a certain age, this was probably the first SF they encountered that was written from a mature standpoint and adult sensibility. The fact that Blish also manages to tell a fabulous, galaxy-spanning adventure tale makes this essential reading. <i>--Luc Duplessis</i></p><b>James Blish</b> was one of the great science fiction writers of the twentieth century.

When I saw that house I automatically slowed, knowing soon I'd be home.<br>An acre from that house was our home, sitting isolated and lonely on a road that had more twists and turns than a puzzle maze that leads the mouse to the cheese. We lived in Fairfax, Marin County, about twenty miles north of San Francisco. There was a redwood forest on the other side of the mountains, and the ocean too. Ours was a cold place, sometimes dreary. The fog would roll in in great billowing waves and often shrouded the landscape all day, turning everything cold and eerie. The fog was spooky, but it was also romantic and mysterious.<br>As much as I loved my home, I had vague, disturbing memories of a southern garden full of giant magnolia trees dripping with Spanish moss. I remembered a tall man with dark hair turning gray; a man who called me his son. I didn't remember his face nearly as well as I remembered the nice warm and safe feeling he gave me. I guess one of the saddest things about growing bigger, and older, was that no one was large enough, or strong enough, to pick you up and hold you close and make you feel that safe again.<br>Chris was my mother's third husband. My own father died before I was born; his name was Julian Marquet, and everyone in the ballet world knew about him. Hardly anyone outside of Clairmont, South Carolina, knew about Dr. Paul Scott Sheffield, who had been my mother's second husband. In that same southern state, in the town of Greenglenna, lived my paternal grandmother, Madame Marisha.<br>She was the one who wrote me a letter each week, and once a summer we visited her. It seemed she wanted almost as much as I did, for me to become the most famous dancer the world had ever known. And thus I would prove to her, and to everyone, that my father had not lived and died in vain.<br>By no means was my grandmother an ordinary little old lady going on seventy-four. Once she'd been very famous, and not for one second did she let anyone forget this. It was a rule I was never to call her Grandmother when others could overhear and possibly guess her age. She'd whispered to me once that it would be all right if I called her <i>Mother,</i> but that didn't seem right when I already had a mother whom I loved very much. So I called her Madame Marisha, or Madame M., just as everyone else did.<br>Our yearly visit to South Carolina was long anticipated during the winters, and quickly forgotten once we were back and safely snuggled in our little valley where our long redwood house nestled. "Safe in the valley where the wind doesn't blow," my mother said often. Too often, really -- as if the wind blowing greatly distressed her.<br>I reached our curving drive, parked my bike and went inside the house. No sign of Bart or Mom. Heck! I raced into the kitchen where Emma was preparing dinner. She spent most of her time in the kitchen, and that accounted for her "pleasingly plump" figure. She had a long, dour face unless she was smiling; fortunately, she smiled most of the time. She could order you to do this, do that, and with her smile take the pain from the ordeal of doing for yourself, which was something my brother Bart refused to do. I suspected Emma waited on Bart more than me because he spilled when he tried to pour his own milk. He dropped when he carried a glass of water. There wasn't anything he could hold onto, and nothing he could keep from bumping into. Tables fell, lamps toppled. If an extension wire was anywhere in the house Bart would be sure to snag his sneaker toes underneath and down he'd go -- or the blender, the mixer, or the radio, would crash to the floor.<br>"Where's Bart?" I asked Emma, who was peeling potatoes to put in with the roast beef she had in the oven.<br>"I tell you, Jory, I'll be glad when that boy stays in school just as long as you do. I hate to see him come in the kitchen. I have to stop what I'm doing and look around and anticipate just what he might knock off or bump into. Thank God he's got that wall to sit on. What is it you boys do up on that wall, anyway?"<br>"Nothing," I said. I didn't want to tell her how often we stole over to the deserted mansion beyond the wall and played there. The estate was off-limits to us, but parents weren't supposed to see and know everything. Next I asked "Where's Mom?" Emma said she'd come home early after cancelling her ballet class, which I already knew. "Half her class has colds," I explained. "But where is she now?"<br>"Jory, I can't keep my eye on everybody and still know what <i>I'm</i> doing. A few minutes ago she said something about going up to the attic for old pictures. Why don't you join her up there and help her search?"<br>That was Emma's nice way of saying I was in her way. I headed for the attic stairs, which were hidden in the far end of our large walk-in linen closet in the back hall. Just as I was passing through the family room I heard the front door open and close. To my surprise I saw my dad standing stock-stiff in the foyer, a strange look of reflection in his blue eyes, making me reluctant to call out and break into his thoughts. I paused, undecided.<br>He headed for his bedroom after he put down his black doctor's bag. He had to pass the linen closet with its door slightly ajar. He stopped, listening as I was to the faint sound of ballet music drifting down the stairs. Why was my mother up there? Dancing there again? Whenever I asked why she danced in such a dusty place, she explained she was "compelled" to dance up there, despite the heat and dust. "Don't you tell your father about this," she'd warned me several times. After I questioned her, she'd stopped going up there -- and now she was doing it again.<br>This time I was going up. This time I was going to listen to the excuses she gave <i>him.</i> For Dad would catch her!<br>On tiptoe I trailed him up the steep, narrow stairs. He paused directly under the bare electric bulb that hung down from the apex of the attic. He riveted his eyes upon my mom, who kept right on dancing as if she didn't see him there. She held a dustmop in one hand and playfully swiped at this or that, miming Cinderella and certainly not Princess Aurora from <i>The Sleeping Beauty,</i> which was the music she had on the ancient record player.<br>Gosh. My stepfather's heart seemed to jump right up into his eyes. He looked scared, and I sensed she was hurting him just by dancing in the attic. How odd. I didn't understand what went on between them. I was fourteen, Bart was nine, and we were both a long, long way from being adults. The love they had for each other seemed to me very different from the love I saw between the parents of the few friends I had. Their love seemed more intense, more tumultuous, more passionate. Whenever they thought no one was watching they locked eyes, and they had to reach out and touch whenever they passed one another.<br>Now that I was an adolescent, I was beginning to take more notice of what went on between the most meaningful models I had. I wondered often about the different facets my parents had. One for the public to view; another for Bart and me, and the third, most fervent side, which they showed only to each other. (How could they know their two sons were not always discreet enough to turn away and leave like they should?)<br>Maybe that was the way all adults were, especially parents.<br>Dad kept staring as Mom whirled in fast <i>pirouettes</i> that fanned her long blonde hair out in a half circle. Her leotards were white, her <i>pointes</i> white too, and I was enthralled as she danced, wielding that dust-mop like a sword to stab at old furniture that Bart and I had outgrown. Scattered on the floor and shelves were broken toys, kiddy-cars and scooters, dishes she or Emma had broken that she meant to glue back together one day. With each swipe of her dustmop she brought zillions of golden dustmotes into play. Frenzied and crazy they struggled to settle down before she attacked again and once more drove them into flight.<br>"Depart!" she cried, as a queen to her slaves. "Go and stay away! Torment me no more!" -- and round and round she spun, so fast I had to turn to follow her with my eyes or end up dizzy just from watching. She whipped her head, her leg, doing <i>fouettes</i> with more expertise than I'd seen on stage. Wild and possessed she spun faster! faster! keeping time to the music, using the mop as part of her action, making housework so dramatic I wanted to kick off my shoes and jump in and join her and be the partner my real father had once been. But I could only stand in the dim purplish shadows and watch something I sensed I shouldn't be watching.<br>My dad swallowed over the lump which must have risen in his throat. Mom looked so beautiful, so young and soft. She was thirty-seven, so old in years but so young in appearance, and so easily she could be wounded by an unkind word. Just as easily as any sixteen-year-old dancer in her classes.<br>"Cathy!" cried Dad, jerking the needle from the record so the music screeched to a halt. "STOP! What are you doing?"<br>She heard and fluttered her slim pale arms in mock fright, flittering toward him, using the tiny, even steps called <i>bourr�s.</i> For a second or so only, before she was again spinning in a series of <i>pirouettes</i> around him, encircling him-and swiping at him with her dustmop! "STOP IT!" he yelled, seizing hold of her mop and hurling it away. He grabbed her waist, pinioning her arms to her sides as a deep blush rose to stain her cheeks. He released his hold enough to allow her arms to flutter like broken bird wings so her hands could cover her throat. Above those crossed pale hands her blue eyes grew larger and very dark. Her full lips began to quiver, and slowly, slowly, with awful reluctance she was forced to look where Dad's finger pointed.<br>I looked too and was surprised to see two twin beds set up in the portion of the attic that was soon to be under construction. Dad had promised her we'd have a recreation room up here. But twin beds in all this junk? Why?<br>Mom spoke then, her voice husky and scared. "Chris? You're home? You don't usually come home this early..."<br>He'd caught her and I was relieved. Now he could straighten her out, tell her not to dance up here again in the dry, dusty air that could make her faint. Even I could see she was having trouble coming up with some excuse.<br>"Cathy, I know I brought those bedsteads up, but how did you manage to put them together?" Dad shot out. "How did you manage the mattresses?" Then he jolted for a second time, spying the picnic hamper between the beds. "Cathy!" he roared, glaring at her. "Does history have to repeat itself? Can't we learn and benefit from the mistakes of others? <i>Do we have to do it all over again?"</i><br>Again? What was he talking about?<br>"Catherine," Dad went on in the same cold, hard voice, "don't stand there and try to look innocent, like some wicked child caught stealing. Why are those beds here, all made up with clean sheets and new blankets? Why the picnic hamper? Haven't we seen enough of that type of basket to last us our whole lives through?"<br>And here I was thinking she'd put the beds together so she and I could have a place to fall down and rest after we danced, as we had a few times. And a picnic hamper was, after all, just another basket.<br>I drifted closer, then hid behind a strut that rose to the rafters. Something sad and painful was between them; something young, fresh, like a raw wound that refused to heal. My mother looked ashamed and suddenly awkward. The man I called Dad stood bewildered; I could tell he wanted to take her in his arms and forgive her. "Cathy, Cathy," he pleaded with anguish, "don't be like <i>her</i> in every way!"<br>Mom jerked her head high, threw back her shoulders, and, with arrogant pride, glared him down. She flipped her long hair back from her face and smiled to charm him. Was she doing all of that just to make him stop asking questions she didn't want to answer?<br>I felt strangely cold in the musty gloom of the attic. A chilling shiver raced down my spine, making me want to run and hide. Making me ashamed, too, for spying -- that was Bart's way, not mine.<br>How could I escape without attracting their attention? I <i>had</i> to stay in my hidden place.<br>"Look at me, Cathy. You're not the sweet young ingenue anymore, and this is not a game. There is no reason for those beds to be there. And the picnic basket only compounds my fears. <i>What the hell are you planning?"</i><br>Her arms spread wide as if to hug him, but he pushed her away and spoke again: "Don't try to appeal to me when I feel sick to my stomach. I ask myself each day how I can come home and not be tired of you, and still feel as I do after so many years, and after all that has happened. Yet I go on year after year loving you, needing and trusting you. Don't take my love and make it into something ugly!"<br>Bewilderment clouded her expression. I'm sure it clouded mine too. Didn't he truly love her? Was that what he meant? Mom was staring at the beds again, as if surprised to see them there.<br>"Chris, help me!" she choked, stepping closer and opening her arms again. He put her off, shaking his head. She implored, "Please don't shake your head and act like you don't understand. I don't remember buying the basket, really I don't! I had a dream the other night about coming up here and putting the beds together, but when I came up today and saw them, I thought you must have put them there."<br>"Cathy! I DID <i>NOT</i> PUT THE BEDS THERE!"<br>"Move out of the shadows. I can't see you where you are." She lifted her small pale hands, seeming to wipe away invisible cobwebs. Then she was staring at her hands as if they'd betrayed her -- or was she really seeing spiderwebs tying her fingers together?<br>Just as my dad did, I looked around again. Never had the attic been so clean before. The floor had been scrubbed, cartons of old junk were stacked neatly. She had tried to make the attic look homey by hanging pretty pictures of flowers on the walls.<br>Dad was eyeing Mom as if she were crazy. I wondered what he was thinking, and why he couldn't tell what bothered her when he was the best doctor ever. Was he trying to decide if she was only pretending to forget? Did that dazed, troubled look in her terrified eyes tell him differently? Must have, for he said softly, kindly, "Cathy, you don't have to look scared. You're <i>not</i> swimming in a sea of deceit anymore, or helplessly caught in an undertow. You are <i>not</i> drowning. <i>Not</i> going under. <i>Not</i> having a nightmare. You don't have to clutch at straws when you have me." Then he drew her into his arms as she fell toward him, grasping as if to keep from drowning. "You're all right, darling," he whispered, stroking her back, touching her cheeks, drying the tears that began to flow. Tenderly he tilted her chin up before his lips slowly lowered to hers. The kiss lasted and lasted, making me hold my breath.<br>"The grandmother is dead. Foxworth Hall has been burned to the ground."<br><i>Foxworth Hall? What was that?</i><br>"No, it hasn't, Chris. I heard her climbing the stairs a short while ago, and you know she's afraid of small, confined places -- how could she climb the stairs?"<br>"Were you sleeping when you heard her?"<br>I shivered. What the devil were they talking about? Which grandmother?<br>"Yes," she murmured, her lips moving over his face. "I guess I did drift into nig...</p><h2>The Passionate Mom: Dare to Parent in Today&#39;s World</h2><p><p><b>Motherhood is full of uncertainty.What do my children <i>really</i> need?

Seventy years after the historical march took place, Sun Shuyun set out to retrace the Marchers&#x2019; steps and unexpectedly discovered the true history behind the legend. <i>The Long March</i> is the stunning narrative of her extraordinary expedition. <br><br>The facts are these: in 1934, in the midst of a brutal civil war, the Communist party and its 200,000 soldiers were forced from their bases by Chiang Kaishek and his Nationalist troops. After that, truth and legend begin to blur: led by Mao Zedong, the Communists set off on a strategic retreat to the distant barren north of China, thousands of miles away. Only one in five Marchers reached their destination, where, the legend goes, they gathered strength and returned to launch the new China in the heat of revolution.<br><br>As Sun Shuyun journeys to remote villages along the Marchers&#x2019; route, she interviews the aged survivors and visits little-known local archives. She uncovers shocking stories of starvation, disease, and desertion, of ruthless purges ordered by party leaders, of the mistreatment of women, and of thousands of futile deaths. Many who survived the March report that their suffering continued long after the &#x201c;triumph&#x201d; of the revolution, recounting tales of persecution and ostracism that culminated in the horrific years of the Cultural Revolution. <br><br>What emerges from Sun&#x2019;s research, her interviews, and her own memories of growing up in China is a moving portrait of China past and present. Sun finds that the forces at work during the days of the revolution&#x2014;the barren, unforgiving landscape; the unifying power of outside threats from foreign countries; Mao&#x2019;s brilliant political instincts and his use of terror, propaganda, and ruthless purges to consolidate power and control the population&#x2014;are the very forces that made China what it is today. <br><br><i>The Long March</i> is a gripping retelling of an amazing historical adventure, an eye-opening account of how Mao manipulated the event for his own purposes, and a beautiful document of a country balanced between legend and the truth.</p></p><p><p>Sun Shuyun was born in China in the 1960s. She graduated from Beijing University and won a scholarship to Oxford. A filmmaker and television producer, she has made documentaries for the BBC, Channel 4, PBS, and the Discovery Channel. For the past decade, she has divided her time between London and Beijing.</p>1 * DRAIN THE POND TO CATCH THE FISH<br><i>I&#x2019;m sending you to the Army my man,<br>You must see the reason why<br>The Revolution is for us.<br>I&#x2019;m sending you to do or die.<br>Here&#x2019;s a towel I've embroidered<br>With all my love to say:<br>Revolution for ever!<br>The Party you must not betray!</i><br>The song pierced the silence of Shi Village, which nestled at the foot of a hill covered in thick bamboo groves. It was mid&#x2013;October, 1935, in Jiangxi Province, southern China. The autumn harvest was already in and the land surrounding the village was yellow with the stubble of rice stalks, but some fields stood as if wasted, with grass sprouting in the dried&#x2013;out paddy, already turning brown. A few water buffalo were plodding home, only stopping when they came to their favorite place, the village pond, where they drank, ducks and geese swam, children bathed, women washed their clothes, and men asked one another about their day. Nearby stood the giant camphor tree, whose overhanging branches gave ample shelter from the rain and intense heat of the South.<br><br>Today the water buffalo had the pond to themselves, and only the village ancestor shrine opposite showed signs of life, but not with pious prayers and hypnotic chants offered to the ancestors: only the revolutionary song calling on young men to join the Red Army. Through the imposing entrance topped by grey&#x2013;tiled eaves, boys carrying spears rushed in and out, looking solemn, as if they had been entrusted with the most important task of their lives. Two young women were putting a table and some benches outside the gate. As the song died away, more women came out, clutching shoes they were making out of cloth, calling their children, while others gathered up firewood from outside the gate, and went home to cook.<br><br>&#x201c;Nobody is too tired to sing! Keep up the good work!&#x201d; called Wang Quanyuan, the young woman who had just emerged from a house nearby. She had on a grey cotton jacket, the kind every soldier wore, tied with a rope round her waist, but its simplicity made her beauty stand out even more. She asked one woman to bring more benches, and then stopped one of the boys who was running by, and whispered something in his ear; nodding eagerly, he took to his heels.<br><br>Wang noticed the slogans on the white wall of the shrine, written in black ink but slightly washed out by the summer rain. &#x201c;Down with the Landlords and Evil Gentry!&#x201d; &#x201c;Long Live the Communists!&#x201d; &#x201c;Long Live the Soviet!&#x201d; &#x201c;I mustn&#x2019;t forget to tell them to repaint the slogans,&#x201d; she murmured to herself, remembering that until four years ago she had no idea what Soviet was. Someone had told her that it was a foreign shop, and others said he was the brother of a famous Communist labor organizer. A warlord definitely thought so: he had posted a notice throughout the villages, offering a reward for the capture, dead or alive, of Mr. Soviet. In the local dialect, Soviet was pronounced Su&#x2013;wei&#x2013;ai, which meant &#x201c;we,&#x201d; so perhaps the Soviet was our government, she once thought. Now she was actually working for the youth and women's departments of the Soviet, a government of workers and peasants that had been set up by Mao and his Red Army in southern Jiangxi in 1931. Small as it was, with barely three million people in half a dozen counties, hemmed in on all sides by Chiang Kaishek's Nationalist troops, the Jiangxi Soviet had all the functions of a state. Wang was told that the Communist Party was working to turn the whole of China into a Soviet. That would be the day, Wang smiled, but then became very solemn. &#x201c;Everything hangs on tonight,&#x201d; she muttered to herself.<br><br>As darkness fell, the bell hanging from the camphor tree rang out. Four giant bamboo torches lit up the pond and the gate of the shrine hall. Women, and a few men, old and young, gathered with several hundred people from nearby villages, summoned by Wang&#x2019;s Red Pioneers. She had also sent for half a dozen militiamen from the county Party headquarters; when they finally arrived, Wang stood up and delivered her speech:<br><br>&#x201c;Sisters and brothers, grandfathers and grandmothers, the Red Army is at its most critical time now, with many wounded every day. But in a war, there is always winning and losing. If we stop fighting just because we have lost a few battles, our Revolution will never succeed and we will always be exploited by the rich. You are strong. Do you want to be trampled on for the rest of your lives? If not, join the Red Army now!&#x201d;<br><br>There was no reply.<br><br>Wang nodded to the militiamen who were standing close by, and continued: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be afraid. We will win. Use your brain. This village has hundreds of poor people, and only one or two landlords. Aren&#x2019;t we more powerful than them? All we need to do is to unite, but there is a traitor who does not want this to happen. He seems to care about you, telling you to keep your men at home, but if we all stay at home, our enemy will come, taking our land and raping our women. Is that what you want?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course not!&#x201d; shouted the militiamen.<br><br>&#x201c;Then let&#x2019;s bring the traitor out.&#x201d; Wang waved her hand. Two militiamen appeared from behind the shrine gate, each holding the arm of a man, followed by a third with a pistol in his hand. Silence fell and the villagers looked at each other speechless. The accused was none other than the Party secretary of their district, Mr. Liu. Suddenly, a Red Pioneer raised his arm, shouting, &#x201c;Down with the traitor! Kill the traitor!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me, what do you want done with him?&#x201d; Wang asked several times.<br><br>&#x201c;Kill him,&#x201d; yelled a militiaman.<br><br>&#x201c;Kill him now!&#x201d; a chorus of voices followed.<br><br>Two shots at point&#x2013;blank range and Liu fell to the ground. Wang announced grimly: &#x201c;This will be the fate of anyone who dares to sabotage the Revolution.&#x201d;<br><br>It was hard to believe, when I met Woman Wang, that she had ever done such things, or suffered more than I could bear to think about. She had started as the quintessential supporter of the Revolution. Poverty had made her family sell her into a marriage which she did not want; joining the Communists represented hope. Chosen as one of only 30 women to go with the 1st Army among 86,000 men, she survived and rose to head the Red Army&#x2019;s only women&#x2019;s regiment. A year later, she was captured, raped, and given to a Nationalist officer as a concubine&#x2014;a &#x201c;crime&#x201d; for which she was denounced by the Party, remaining under a cloud for the next fifty years. Still, she remained loyal to the Party, which she regarded as dearer to her than her parents. I remember thinking to myself after reading her biography: if there was ever a true Communist faithful, it must be Wang.<br><br>What better way to start my journey than by talking to her? I set out in October 2004, exactly seventy years after the Chinese Communist Party and the 1st Army abandoned their base in Jiangxi and began their escape from the Nationalists&#x2014;the Long March as it became known. From Beijing I took the train, eighteen hours due south, and then after two hours more by bus through green-clad mountains and hills I found myself in Taihe in southern Jiangxi. It was a big town, with a grand new avenue, beautifully surfaced and complete with modern lighting&#x2014;not many buildings yet, but looking for twenty&#x2013;first&#x2013;century growth. I wondered if I would have trouble finding Wang&#x2014;after all, Taihe had a population of half a million people and all I had was her biography, which I had been rereading on the train. I took a rickshaw from the long&#x2013;distance bus stop and mentioned Wang&#x2019;s name hesitantly; I was relieved when the driver told me to take it easy. &#x201c;What a woman! How many went on the Long March from Jiangxi? Eighty thousand? I guess not many of them are left today. Three in this town, and forty in Jiangxi. If you come next year, they will probably all be gone.&#x201d; He took me down the big avenue and then into the old quarter. Dusty, narrow, busy, and crowded, just like the photographs of provincial towns in the 1930s. I was dropped off next to a dumpling shop with a queue of hungry customers. Behind it was Wang's courtyard, shaded by a pomegranate tree with its dark red fruit just bursting open. Beneath it, there she sat, looking gentle, serene, and elegant, belying her 91 years, and without a trace of the toughness of the Red Army commander.<br><br>She was not surprised to see me, a complete stranger, walking in off the street and wanting to find out about her past. My copy of her biography was a good enough introduction. She asked me to sit down and called, &#x201c;Another visitor from Beijing!&#x201d; A middle&#x2013;aged woman came out. From what I had read, I assumed she was her adopted daughter&#x2014;Wang was unable to conceive after the Long March. &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t ask too many questions, she gets too excited. Last week we had a journalist from Beijing, and she talked so much, it made her ill. Anyway, it is all in there,&#x201d; she said, referring to the book on my lap. Wang cut her short. &#x201c;They think talking is a waste of breath, but they don&#x2019;t understand. So many men and women died for the good life we live today and I want people to remember that.&#x201d; She sent her daughter back inside for another biography, written by a local Party historian. &#x201c;You might not have come across it.&#x201d;<br><br>The daughter came out with the book and a tray of sliced watermelon. &#x201c;Eat now, read later. I will answer all your questions. It will take you a few days&#x2014;you see, unfortunately, I have had such a long life.&#x201d; She took a mouthful of the melon, and smiled, as if it was the rarest fruit in the world and she was tasting it for the first time. Clearly she was keen to talk. She was quick and warm, and over the next three days she opened up like the pomegranates&#x2014;I heard of th...</p><h2>The Ellis Island Immigrant Cookbook</h2><p>Through recipes and poignant stories, the Ellis Island Immigrant Cookbook gives insight to the struggles of our ancestral immigrants.</p><p></p><h2>Nana I Ke Kumu - Look to the Source, Volume 1 (Hawaiian Folktales)</h2><p>Facts about the ways of the old Hawaiians based on years of interviews with Native Hawaiians.</p><p></p><h2>Williamsburg: Decorating with Style: The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation</h2><p>One of the delights of a visit to Colonial Williamsburg, the restored colonial capital of Virginia, is discovering the great treasury of design to be found in its historic buildings. Every room of every authentically appointed home, shop, and tavern offers inspiration for today's home decorators. Now a selection of these exciting interiors (many of them completely repainted and refurnished according to the latest archaeological information on colonial life), along with contemporary interpretations by best-selling decorating author Tricia Foley, is collected here in the first book devoted exclusively to Williamsburg design.<br><br>To make the book useful for home decorators, design ideas are presented room by room: Living Rooms and Gathering Places; The Bedchamber; Dining Rooms, Kitchens, and Pantries; and Home and Garden. Interspersed with the rooms are sections highlighting details of particular importance for 18th- and 20th-century decorators alike: color, mantels, lighting, bed hangings, fabrics, window treatments, floorcloths, china, silver, settees, doors and shutters, staircases, fences and gates, and benches. Following each chapter are the "contemporary interpretations" by Tricia Foley--dozens of rooms decorated using the reproductions, fabrics, and accessories from the Colonial Williamsburg licensing program. Traditional decorating has never looked so fresh, so modern, so livable as it does in these pages.<br><br>With more than 275 photographs by Jeff McNamara of Williamsburg's homes and gardens, an engaging text by Catherine Calvert comparing modern living with the past, and a resource guide that helps the reader locate the perfect reproductions, <b>Williamsburg: Decorating with Style</b> offers a look into the rich heritage of early American design, and confirms its enduring value for our own lifestyles. <br><br>The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation was established in the 1920s by John D.

I slide the door down and pull the latch shut, locking up eighteen years of memories, all of which include my dad.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s been six months since he passed away. Long enough that my nine-year-old brother, Kel, doesn&#x2019;t cry every time we talk about him, but recent enough that we&#x2019;re being forced to accept the financial aftermath that comes to a newly single-parented household. A household that can&#x2019;t afford to remain in Texas and in the only home I&#x2019;ve ever known.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lake, stop being such a downer,&#x201d; my mom says, handing me the keys to the house. &#x201c;I think you&#x2019;ll love Michigan.&#x201d;<br> <br>She never calls me by the name she legally gave me. She and my dad argued for nine months over what I would be named. She loved the name Layla, after the Eric Clapton song. Dad loved the name Kennedy, after a Kennedy. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter which Kennedy,&#x201d; he would say. &#x201c;I love them all!&#x201d;<br> <br>I was almost three days old before the hospital forced them to decide. They agreed to take the first three letters of both names and compromised on Layken, but neither of them has ever once referred to me as such.<br> <br>I mimic my mother&#x2019;s tone, &#x201c;Mom, stop being such an upper! I&#x2019;m going to hate Michigan.&#x201d;<br> <br>My mother has always had an ability to deliver an entire lecture with a single glance. I get the glance.<br> <br>I walk up the porch steps and head inside the house to make a walk-through before the final turn of the key. All of the rooms are eerily empty. It doesn&#x2019;t seem as though I&#x2019;m walking through the house where I&#x2019;ve lived since the day I was born. These last six months have been a whirlwind of emotions, all of them bad. Moving out of this home was inevitable&#x2014;I realize that. I just expected it to happen after the end of my senior year.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m standing in what is no longer our kitchen when I catch a glimpse of a purple plastic hair clip under the cabinet in the space where the refrigerator once stood. I pick it up, wipe the dust off of it, and run it back and forth between my fingers.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll grow back,&#x201d; Dad said.<br> <br>I was five years old, and my mother had left her trimming scissors on the bathroom counter. Apparently, I had done what most kids of that age do. I cut my own hair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mommy&#x2019;s going to be so mad at me,&#x201d; I cried. I thought that if I cut my hair, it would immediately grow back, and no one would notice. I cut a pretty wide chunk out of my bangs and sat in front of the mirror for probably an hour, waiting for the hair to grow back. I picked the straight brown strands up off the floor and held them in my hand, contemplating how I could secure them back to my head, when I began to cry.<br> <br>When Dad walked into the bathroom and saw what I had done, he just laughed and scooped me up, then positioned me on the countertop. &#x201c;Mommy&#x2019;s not going to notice, Lake,&#x201d; he promised as he removed something out of the bathroom cabinet. &#x201c;I just happen to have a piece of magic right here.&#x201d; He opened up his palm and revealed the purple clip. &#x201c;As long as you have this in your hair, Mommy will never know.&#x201d; He brushed the remaining strands of hair across and secured the clip in place. He then turned me around to face the mirror. &#x201c;See? Good as new!&#x201d;<br> <br>I looked at our reflection in the mirror and felt like the luckiest girl in the world. I didn&#x2019;t know of any other dad who had magic clips.<br> <br>I wore that clip in my hair every day for two months, and my mother never once mentioned it. Now that I look back on it, I realize he probably told her what I had done. But when I was five, I believed in his magic.<br> <br>I look more like my mother than like him. Mom and I are both of average height. After having two kids, she can&#x2019;t really fit into my jeans, but we&#x2019;re pretty good at sharing everything else. We both have brown hair that, depending on the weather, is either straight or wavy. Her eyes are a deeper emerald than mine, although it could be that the paleness of her skin just makes them more prominent.<br> <br>I favor my dad in all the ways that count. We had the same dry sense of humor, the same personality, the same love of music, the same laugh. Kel is a different story. He takes after our dad physically with his dirty-blond hair and soft features. He&#x2019;s on the small side for nine years old, but his personality makes up for what he lacks in size.<br> <br>I walk to the sink and turn it on, rubbing my thumb over the thirteen years of grime collected on the hair clip. Kel walks backward into the kitchen just as I&#x2019;m drying my hands on my jeans. He&#x2019;s a strange kid, but I couldn&#x2019;t love him more. He has a game he likes to play that he calls &#x201c;backward day,&#x201d; in which he spends most of the time walking everywhere backward, talking backward, and even requesting dessert first. I guess with such a big age difference between him and me and no other siblings, he has to find a way to entertain himself somehow.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hurry to says Mom Layken!&#x201d; he says, backward.<br> <br>I place the hair clip in the pocket of my jeans and head back out the door, locking up my home for the very last time.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>OVER THE NEXT few days, my mother and I alternate driving my Jeep and the U-Haul, stopping only twice at hotels to sleep. Kel switches between Mom and me, riding the final day with me in the U-Haul. We complete the last exhausting nine-hour stretch through the night, only stopping once for a short break. As we close in on our new town of Ypsilanti, I take in my surroundings and the fact that it&#x2019;s September but my heater is on. I&#x2019;ll definitely need a new wardrobe.<br> <br>As I make a final right-hand turn onto our street, my GPS informs me that I&#x2019;ve &#x201c;reached my destination.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My destination,&#x201d; I laugh aloud to myself. My GPS doesn&#x2019;t know squat.<br> <br>The cul-de-sac is not very long, lined with about eight single-story brick houses on each side of the street. There&#x2019;s a basketball goal in one of the driveways, which gives me hope that Kel might have someone to play with. Honestly, it looks like a decent neighborhood. The lawns are manicured, the sidewalks are clean, but there&#x2019;s too much concrete. Way too much concrete. I already miss home.<br> <br>Our new landlord emailed us pictures of the house, so I immediately spot which one is ours. It&#x2019;s small. It&#x2019;s really small. We had a ranch-style home on several acres of land in Texas. The minuscule amount of land surrounding this home is almost nothing but concrete and garden gnomes. The front door is propped open, and I see an older man who I assume is our new landlord come outside and wave.<br> <br>I drive about fifty yards past the house so that I can back into the driveway, where the rear of the U-Haul will face the front door. Before I put the gearshift in reverse, I reach over and shake Kel awake. He&#x2019;s been passed out since Indiana.<br> <br>&#x201c;Kel, wake up,&#x201d; I whisper. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve reached our destination.&#x201d;<br> <br>He stretches his legs out and yawns, then leans his forehead against the window to get a look at our new house. &#x201c;Hey, there&#x2019;s a kid in the yard!&#x201d; Kel says. &#x201c;Do you think he lives in our house, too?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He better not,&#x201d; I reply. &#x201c;But he&#x2019;s probably a neighbor. Hop out and go introduce yourself while I back up.&#x201d;<br> <br>When the U-Haul is successfully backed in, I put the gearshift in park, roll down the windows, and kill the engine. My mother pulls in beside me in my Jeep and I watch as she gets out and greets the landlord. I crouch down a few inches in the seat and prop my foot against the dash, watching Kel and his new friend sword fight with imaginary swords in the street. I&#x2019;m jealous of him. Jealous of the fact that he can accept the move so easily, and I&#x2019;m stuck being the angry, bitter child.<br> <br>He was upset when Mom first decided on the move. Mostly because he was in the middle of his Little League season. He had friends he would miss, but at the age of nine your best friend is usually imaginary, and transatlantic. Mom subdued him pretty easily by promising he could sign up for hockey, something he wanted to do in Texas. It was a hard sport to come by in the rural south. After she agreed to that, he was pretty upbeat, if not stoked, about Michigan.<br> <br>I understand why we had to move. Dad had made a respectable living managing a paint store. Mom worked PRN as a nurse when she needed to, but mostly tended to the house and to us. About a month after he died, she was able to find a full-time job. I could see the stress of my father&#x2019;s death taking its toll on her, along with being the new head of household.<br> <br>One night over dinner, she explained to us that she wasn&#x2019;t left with enough income to continue paying all the bills and the mortgage. She said there was a job that could pay her more, but we would have to move. She was offered a job by her old high-school friend Brenda. They grew up together in my mother&#x2019;s hometown of Ypsilanti, right outside of Detroit. It paid more than anything she could find in Texas, so she had no choice but to accept. I don&#x2019;t blame her for the move. My grandparents are deceased, and she has no one to help her. I understand why we had to do it, but understanding a situation doesn&#x2019;t always make it easier.<br> <br>&#x201c;Layken, you&#x2019;re dead!&#x201d; Kel shouts through the open window, thrusting his imaginary sword into my neck. He waits for me to slump over, but I just roll my eyes at him. &#x201c;I stabbed you. You&#x2019;re supposed to die!&#x201d; he says.<br> <br>&#x201c;Believe me, I&#x2019;m already dead,&#x201d; I mumble as I open the door and climb out. Kel&#x2019;s shoulders are slumped forward and he&#x2019;s staring down at the concrete, his imaginary sword limp by his side. Kel&#x2019;s new friend stands behind him looking just as defeated, causing me immediately to regret the transference of my bad mood.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m already dead,&#x201d; I say in my best monster voice, &#x201c;because I&#x2019;m a zombie !&#x201d;<br> <br>They start screaming as I stretch my arms out in front of me, cock my head to the side, and make a gurgling sound. &#x201c;Brains!&#x201d; I grumble, walking stiff-legged after them around the U-Haul. &#x201c;Brains!&#x201d;<br> <br>I slowly round the front of the U-Haul, holding my arms out in front of me, when I notice someone grasping my brother and his new friend by the collars of their shirts.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get &#x2019;em!&#x201d; The stranger yells as he holds the two screaming boys.<br> <br>He looks a couple of years older than me and quite a bit taller. &#x201c;Hot&#x201d; would be how most girls would describe him, but I&#x2019;m not most girls. The boys are flailing around, and his muscles flex under his shirt as he tries hard to maintain his grip on them.<br> <br>Unlike Kel and me, these two are unmistakably siblings. Aside from the obvious age difference, they&#x2019;re identical. They both have the same smooth olive skin, the same jet-black hair, even the same cropped hairstyle. He&#x2019;s laughing as Kel breaks free and starts slicing at him with his &#x201c;sword.&#x201d; He looks up at me and mouths &#x201c;Help,&#x201d; when I realize I&#x2019;m still frozen in my zombie pose.<br> <br>My first instinct is to crawl back inside the U-Haul and hide on the floorboard for the remainder of my life. Instead, I yell &#x201c;Brains&#x201d; once more and lunge forward, pretending to bite the younger boy on top of his head. I grab Kel and his new friend and start tickling them until they melt into heaps on the concrete driveway.<br> <br>As I straighten up, the older brother extends his hand. &#x201c;Hey, I&#x2019;m Will. We live across the street,&#x201d; he says, pointing to the house directly across from ours.<br> <br>I reciprocate his handshake. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Layken. I guess I live here,&#x201d; I say as I glance toward the house behind me.<br> <br>He smiles. Our handshake lingers as neither one of us says anything. I hate awkward moments.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, welcome to Ypsilanti,&#x201d; he says. He pulls his hand from mine and puts it in his jacket pocket. &#x201c;Where are you guys moving here from?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Texas?&#x201d; I reply. I&#x2019;m not sure why the tail end of my reply comes out like a question. I&#x2019;m not sure why I&#x2019;m even analyzing why it came out like a question. I&#x2019;m not sure why I&#x2019;m analyzing the reason why I&#x2019;m analyzing&#x2014;I&#x2019;m flustered. It must be the lack of sleep I&#x2019;ve gotten over the past three days.<br> <br>&#x201c;Texas, huh?&#x201d; he says. He&#x2019;s rocking back and forth on his heels. The awkwardness intensifies when I fail to respond. He glances down at his brother and bends over, grabbing him by the ankles. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to get this little guy to school,&#x201d; he says as he swings his brother up and over his shoulders. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a cold front coming through tonight. You should try to get as much unloaded today as you can. It&#x2019;s supposed to last a few days, so if you guys need help unloading this afternoon, let me know. We should be home around four.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure, thanks,&#x201d; I say. They head across the street, and I&#x2019;m still watching them when Kel stabs me in my lower back. I drop to my knees and clutch at my stomach, crouching forward as Kel climbs on top of me and finishes me off. I glance across the street again and see Will watching us.

He took a degree in naval architecture at Glasgow University and worked in wood and steel shipyards, intending to design sailing ships. On the outbreak of the Second World War he moved to the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, where he worked on wooden aircraft, plastics and unorthodox materials of all kinds. He designed the sailing rescue dinghies carried at one time by most bomber aircraft. He later became head of the plastic structures sections at Farnborough and developed a method of construction in reinforced plastics which is now used for a number of purpose in aircraft and rockets. For several frustrating years he worked in industry on the strength of glass and the growth of strong &#39;whisker&#39; crystals. In 1962 he returned to government service as superintendent of an experimental branch at Waltham Abbey concerned with research and development of entirely new structural materials, most of which were based on &#39;whiskers&#39;. He was Industrial Fellow Commoner at Churchill College, Cambridge, and became Professor of Materials Technology at the University of Reading, where he was later Professor Emeritus. He was awarded the British Silver Medal of the Royal Aeronautical Society for work on aircraft plastics and also the Griffith Medal of the Materials Science Club for contributions to material science. His book, Structures or Why Things Don&#39;t Fall Down, is also published in Penguin. Professor Gordon died in 1998. In its obituary The Times wrote of him that he was &#39;one of the founders of materials science&#39; and that he wrote &#39;two books of outstanding literary quality ... at once entertaining and informative, providing absorbing interest for both expert and student&#39;."It is really, really good if you want a primer on structural design."&#x2015;<b>Elon Musk</b><br><br>"Rich and readable...personal, witty, and ironic."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Scientific American</i></i></b><br><br>"Here we have the conversation in the unbuttoned mood of a learned engineer with wide sympathies about his art, its history, its range, and the silly things which happen.

The authors note that it was in no way their aim to provide a complete &#x201c;Lexicon&#x201d; to the Greek New Testament, but rather to show the nature of the new light cast upon its language by these rich stores of newly-found contemporary papyri. Apart from the papyri, considerable use has been made of the Greek inscriptions, and evidence from other non-literary sources has been freely cited, wherever it seemed likely to be useful. Very often words have been included for which the authors&#x2019; non-literary sources provide no illustration, in order to show from literary evidence, if forthcoming, or from its very absence, the relation of such words to the popular Greek. In a book such as this, whose publication has extended over a number of years, it is inevitable that many new examples of the words treated should have come to light. To have included these in the present volume would have seriously delayed publication and added considerably to cost. In these circumstances, the authors thought it best simply to keep a note of the more important additions which have suggested themselves in the hope of utilizing them at a future date. And this course is further justified by the fact that, a far as the authors can gather, the examples which might have been added would do little more than explain or confirm the conclusions already reached.</p><p>James Hope Moulton taught at Cambridge and at Manchester and authored the introductory and morphological volumes in the authoritative <i>Grammar of New Testament Greek.</i><p></p><p>George Milligan taught at Glasgow and authored numerous works pertaining to the New Testament and the papyri.</p></p><h2>Poseidon&#39;s Gold</h2><p>Returning to Rome after his mission to Germania, Falco finds that his mother is being harassed by a centurion named Censorinus, who says he is chasing a debt owed to him by Falcos brother Festus.

This Penguin Modern Classics edition is edited with an introduction and notes by Seamus Deane. The portrayal of Stephen Dedalus&#39;s Dublin childhood and youth, his quest for identity through art and his gradual emancipation from the claims of family, religion and Ireland itself, is also an oblique self-portrait of the young James Joyce and a universal testament to the artist&#39;s &#39;eternal imagination&#39;. Both an insight into Joyce&#39;s life and childhood, and a unique work of modernist fiction, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is a novel of sexual awakening, religious rebellion and the essential search for voice and meaning that every nascent artist must face in order to fully come into themselves. James Joyce (1882-1941), the eldest of ten children, was born in Dublin, but exiled himself to Paris at twenty as a rebellion against his upbringing. He only returned to Ireland briefly from the continent but Dublin was at heart of his greatest works, Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. He lived in poverty until the last ten years of his life and was plagued by near blindness and the grief of his daughter&#39;s mental illness. If you enjoyed A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, you might like Joyce&#39;s Dubliners, also available in Penguin Modern Classics. &#39;There is nothing more vivid or beautiful in all Joyce&#39;s writing.

While some of the stories are traditional, set in &#x201c;Alice Munro Country&#x201d; in Ontario or in B.C., dealing with ordinary women&#x2019;s lives, others have a new, sharper edge. They involve child murders, strange sex, and a terrifying home invasion.

This daring, superb collection proves that Alice Munro will always surprise you.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2009</strong>: "She hated to hear the word 'escape' used about fiction. She might have argued, not just playfully, that it was real life that was the escape. But this was too important to argue about." Taken from a story called "Free Radicals," this line may be the best way to think about the lives unfolding in Alice Munro's <em>Too Much Happiness</em>. Real life assaults her central characters rather brutally--in the forms of murder and madness, death, divorce, and all manner of deceptions--but they respond with a poise and clarity of thought that's disarming--sometimes, even nonchalant--when you consider their circumstances. Her women move through life, wearing their scars but not so much wearied by them, profoundly intelligent, but also inordinately tender and thoughtful. There's more fact than fiction to these stories, rich in quiet, precise details that make for a beautiful, bewildering read. --<em>Anne Bartholomew</em>Now 78, Alice Munro grew up in Wingham, Ontario, and attended the University of Western Ontario.

Over a five-year period starting in 1968, the desperate and disillusioned seized commercial jets nearly once a week, using guns, bombs, and jars of acid. Some hijackers wished to escape to foreign lands, where they imagined being hailed as heroes; others aimed to swap hostages for sacks of cash. Their criminal exploits mesmerized the country, never more so than when the young lovers at the heart of Brendan I. Koerner&#x2019;s <i>The Skies Belong to Us</i> pulled off the longest-distance hijacking in American history.<br><br>A shattered Army veteran and a mischievous party girl, Roger Holder and Cathy Kerkow commandeered Western Airlines Flight 701 as a vague protest against the war. Through a combination of savvy and dumb luck, the couple managed to flee across an ocean with a half-million dollars in ransom, a feat that made them notorious around the globe. Koerner spent four years chronicling this madcap tale, which involves a cast of characters ranging from exiled Black Panthers to African despots to French movie stars. He combed through over 4,000 declassified documents and interviewed scores of key figures in the drama&#x2014;including one of the hijackers, whom Koerner discovered living in total obscurity. Yet <i>The Skies Belong to Us</i> is more than just an enthralling yarn about a spectacular heist and its bittersweet, decades-long aftermath. It is also a psychological portrait of America at its most turbulent, and a testament to the madness that can grip a nation when politics fail.</p><p><b>BRENDAN I.

He has worked as the newspaper's correspondent in New York, Paris and Washington. He is the author of nine books including Agent Zigzag, shortlisted for the Costa Biography Award and the Galaxy British Book Award for Biography of the Year 2008, the number 1 bestseller Operation Mincemeat and, most recently, the Richard &amp; Judy Book Club selection, Double Cross. He lives in London with his wife and three children.A mad curiosity carries an apparently sane young man to a lost German colony in Paraguay. In the picaresque romp that ensues, Macintyre, former foreign correspondent for Britain's Sunday Correspondent, discovers a forgotten people, exonerates Friedrich Nietzsche, and manages to piece together a rather chilling portrait of the troubled philosopher's far more dreadful sister. Not that Elisabeth Nietzsche was all that obscure to begin with: As editor and executrix of her brother's works, she was responsible for misshaping an entire generation of Nietzsche scholarship through a series of blatant misreadings aimed at serving the Nazi cause. A thoroughgoing racist and anti-Semite, she became convinced early on that the purity of the German nation was under siege, and, with her husband Bernard F&#x201d;rster, concocted the idea of an elite German settlement abroad that would eventually replenish and invigorate the downtrodden Aryan blood at home. Paraguay--of all places--was chosen as the most propitious site, and a small band of pioneers set sail in 1886 for what shortly became an unmitigated disaster. The land turned out to be untillable; the climate was deadly; and the finances were mismanaged from the start. Within a few years, F&#x201d;rster killed himself, and Elisabeth returned to Germany to care for her brother (who had lapsed into his final madness). Incredibly enough, the colony managed to survive precariously on its own and maintains itself to this day as a surreal Bismarckian outpost in the Paraguayan jungle. Macintyre weaves together several stories here- -Nietzsche's stormy relations with Wagner; Elisabeth's influence on the Nazis; the fate of the colonists left behind--without weakening the central narrative of his own journey to Nueva Germania and its gente perdita, a journey that was both the impetus and agent for this weird and marvelous tale. Lurid and delightful: Rider Haggard couldn't ask for more. (Thirty-two b&amp;w photos.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

She has been featured in the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Time</i>, <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, <i>Elle</i>, <i>Vogue</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, and <i>The New Yorker</i>, and she speaks regularly at national LGBTQ and political events. A native of Delaware, McBride is on the front lines of the progressive movement.It&#x2019;s rare to know in real time that what you are about to do will define the course of the rest of your life. But as I sat at my laptop in the small office I had been given as student body president at American University, I knew that my world was about to turn upside down.&nbsp; I was about to reveal my deepest secret and take a step that just a few months before would have seemed impossible and unimaginable.<br><br> My hand hovered over the keypad of my laptop, ready yet reluctant to click &#x201c;post&#x201d; on a Facebook note that would change my life forever. I could almost hear the responses I feared would come.<br><br> <i>What a freak. <br>Ew.</i><br> <i>This is disgusting.<br></i><br> And probably the most biting, because I was afraid it was true:&nbsp;<i>Well, there goes any life and future for that kid.</i><br><br>Throughout my whole life until this point, it had always seemed that my dreams and my identity were mutually exclusive. My life had been defined by a constant tension between the two: the belief&#x2014;as certain as the color of the sky&#x2014;that it was impossible for me to have a family, a career, fulfillment, while also embracing the truth that I am a transgender woman.<br> &nbsp;<br> For the first twenty-one years of my life, my dreams&#x2014;the possibility of improving my world and making my family proud&#x2014;had won out over my identity. But the older I got, the harder it became to rationalize away something that had become clear was the core of who I am. And by college, it had enveloped my whole being. It was present every second of my life.<br><br> I no longer had a choice. I couldn&#x2019;t hide anymore. I couldn&#x2019;t continue living someone else&#x2019;s existence. I needed to come out. I needed to tell the world that I was transgender. I needed to live my own life as me.<br><br> A little over a year before, I had been elected student body president at American University. AU, nestled between suburban neighbor- hoods in northwest Washington, D.C., is one of the most politically active schools in the country and boasts a rich history of political milestones. It was the site where John F. Kennedy called for &#x201c;not merely peace in our time, but peace for all time&#x201d; months after the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the home of the younger Ted Kennedy&#x2019;s pivotal endorsement of then-senator Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary.<br><br> I had always loved politics, advocacy, and government. They had seemed like the best way to improve my community and leave a lasting impact on the world. From the ages of six and seven, after discovering the White House and learning about all of the history that occurred within its walls, I knew that politics would be my life&#x2019;s calling.<br><br> When I served as student body president at AU and began working on the issues I had always cared about&#x2014;gender equity, racial justice, opportunity regardless of economic background, and, yes, LGBTQ equality&#x2014;it became clear that making a difference in the world wouldn&#x2019;t diminish or dilute my own pain and incompleteness.<br><br> I had come out to my parents over winter break in the middle of my yearlong term. Since then, I had come out to my closest friends, and as I woke up on the morning of April 30, 2012, my last day as student body president, I was resolved to announce to the world that I was really Sarah McBride.</p><h2>Aliens Omnibus, Vol. 1</h2><p>Dark Horse Comics took the industry by storm with its release of Aliens, a comics series that for the first time captured the power of film source material and expanded its universe in a way that fans applauded worldwide.

LC 82-2815The series of essays that comprise The Federalist constitutes one of the key texts of the American Revolution and the democratic system created in the wake of independence. Written in 1787 and 1788 by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay to promote the ratification of the proposed Constitution, these papers stand as perhaps the most eloquent testimonial to democracy that exists. They describe the ideas behind the American system of government: the separation of powers; the organization of Congress; the respective positions of the executive, legislative, and judiciary; and much more. The Federalist remains essential reading for anyone interested in politics and government, and indeed for anyone seeking a foundational statement about democracy and America. <br>This new edition of The Federalist is edited by Robert Scigliano, a professor in the political science department at Boston College. His substantive Introduction sheds clarifying new light on the historical context and meaning of The Federalist. Scigliano also provides a fresh and definitive analysis of the disputed authorship of several sections of this crucial work.</p><h2>The Civil War: a narrative, Fort Sumter to Perryville</h2><p>261 PAGES RED COVER MINT GIFT GIVING QUALITY BOOK!</p><p>In 1954, Shelby Foote was a young novelist with a contract to write a short history of the Civil War. It soon became clear, however, that he had undertaken a long-term project. Twenty years later Foote finally completed his massive and essential trilogy on the War Between the States. His three books are prose masterpieces with lively characterizations and gripping action. Although Foote never sacrifices the truth of what happened to his penchant for artistry, his skills as a novelist serve him well. Reading all three of these books will take some time, but they are worth the investment--especially if you, like Foote, have a touch of sympathy for the South&#39;s lost cause.FORT SUMTER TO PERRYVILLE <br>"Anyone who wants to relive the Civil War, as thousands of Americans apparently do, will go through this volume with pleasure....

While some aspects of holistic medicine, such as massaging an animal to relax it, are valid, most remedies, such as using flower essences for slipped discs, are useless and could delay an owner's seeking proper treatment for a pet.

The result is a masterful collection of 30 classic tales by Richard Matheson (who also wrote the warmly nostalgic introduction), Charles Beaumont, Ray Bradbury, Damon Knight, Lewis Padgett, Jerome Bixby, and Manly Wade Wellman, among others. Fans of <i>The Twilight Zone</i> will enjoy revisiting their favorite episodes in literary form, but even if you've never seen the show, you'll enjoy this fine anthology. <i>--Stanley Wiater</i></p><h2>A Time to Keep Silence</h2><p>A wonderful insight into the calm and contemplative world of the monastery from a premier travel writer.</p><p>Patrick Leigh Fermor is of English and Irish descent. After his stormy schooldays, followed by his walk across Europe to Constantinople, he lived and travelled in the Balkans and the Greek archipelago acquiring a deep interest in languages and remote places. He joined the Irish Guards, became a liaison officer in Albania, fought in Greece and Crete where, during the German occupation, he returned three times (once by parachute). Disguised as a shepherd he lived for over two years in the mountains, organising the resistance, and led the party that captured and evacuated the German Commander, General Kreipe. He was awarded the DSO and OBE, was made Honorary Citizen of Heraklion, and later of Kardamyli and Gytheion.Bringing the landscape alive as no other writer can, he uses his profound and eclectic understanding of cultures and peoples ... to paint vivid pictures - nobody has illuminated the geography of Europe better * Geographical Magazine * A pleasure and an instruction to read * Irish Times * John Murray is doing the decent thing and reissuing all of Leigh Fermor&#39;s main books ... But what else would you expect from a publisher whose commitment to geography is such that for more than two centuries it has widened our understanding of the world? * Geographical Magazine * Delightful, lucidly written work of introspection that evokes the hardship and the rewards of the solitary life, as well as its beauty * The Glasgow Herald * A most successful attempt to portray the reactions of the man of the world (in the literal sense) when confronted with the monastic life * Daily Telegraph * What a delight it is to read a book so beautifully and sensitively written * Observer * Patrick Leigh Fermor is a stylish, superb master of words, which he savours like the choicest vintage * The Times * Introspection, history, reportage have their balanced places in a well-written book ... measured and lucent * Sunday Times * Delightful ... His book is not only an admirable piece of travel writing; it is also a brilliant piece of human exploration * New Statesman * A brilliant book * Sunday Times * The genius of Patrick Leigh Fermor is a many splendoured thing. Soldier, traveller, writer, Phihellene ... he has already dazzled and delighted ... It is some time since more truth and beauty were distilled into a hundred pages * Stewart Perowne * The English language is still a superb instrument in the hands of a writer who has a virtuoso skill with words, a robust aesthetic passion, an indomitable curiosity and a rapturous historical imagination * Observer *</p><h2>Patty Hearst Her Own Story</h2><p>Patricia Campbell Hearst provides her personal account of her activities and relationships beginning with her kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army on February 4, 1974</p><p><p>HarperCollins Publishers is a proud supporter of First Book, a national nonprofit organization whose mission is to give children from low-income families the opportunity to read and own their own new books.

She received an A.B. in creative writing from Princeton and a master's degree in education from Harvard. Her previous novels include <i>Keeping Faith, The Pact,</i> and <i>Mercy.</i> She lives in New Hampshire with her husband and three children. Her Web site can be found at http://www.jodipicoult.com.<p> <b>Chapter One</b> </p><p> She had often dreamed of her little sister floating dead beneath the surface of the ice, but tonight, for the first time, she envisioned Hannah clawing to get out. She could see Hannah's eyes, wide and milky; could feel Hannah's nails scraping. Then, with a start, she woke. It was not winter -- it was July. There was no ice beneath her palms, just the tangled sheets of her bed. But once again, there was someone on the other side, fighting to be free. </p><p> As the fist in her belly pulled tighter, she bit her bottom lip. Ignoring the pain that rippled and receded, she tiptoed barefoot into the night. </p><p> The barn cat yowled when she stepped inside. She was panting by now, her legs shaking like willow twigs. Lowering herself to the hay in the far corner of the calving pen, she drew up her knees. The swollen cows rolled their blue moon eyes in her direction, then turned away quickly, as if they knew better than to bear witness. </p><p> She concentrated on the hides of the Holsteins until their black spots shimmied and swam. She sank her teeth into the rolled hem of her nightgown. There was a funnel of pressure, as if she were being turned inside out; and she remembered how she and Hannah used to squeeze through the hole in the barbed wire fence by the creek's edge, pushing and angled, all knees and grunts and elbows, until by some miracle they'd tumble through. </p><p> It was over as suddenly as it had begun. And lying on the matted, stained hay between her legs was a baby. </p><p> * * * </p><p> Aaron Fisher rolled over beneath the bright quilt to stare at the clock beside the bed. There had been nothing, no sound to wake him, but after forty-five years of farming and milking, the smallest things could pull him out of sleep: a footfall in the corn, a change in the pattern of the wind, the rasp of a mother's tongue roughing a newborn calf. </p><p> He felt the mattress give as Sarah came up on an elbow behind him, the long braid of her hair curling over her shoulder like a seaman's rope. <i>"Was ist letz?"</i> What's the matter? </p><p> It was not the animals; there was a full month before the first cow was due to deliver. It was not a robber; there was too little noise. He felt his wife's arm slip around him, hugging his back to her front. "Nix," he murmured. Nothing. But he did not know if he was trying to convince Sarah, or himself. </p><p><br> She knew enough to cut the cord that spiraled purple to the baby's belly. Hands shaking, she managed to reach the old scissors that hung on a peg near the pen's door. They were rusty and coated with bits of hay. The cord severed in two thick snips, and then began spurting blood. Horrified, she pressed her fingers to the ends, pinching it shut, wildly looking around for something to tie it off. </p><p> She rummaged in the hay and came up with a small length of baling twine, which she quickly tied around the cord. The bleeding slowed, then stopped. Relieved, she sank back on her elbows -- and then the newborn started to cry. </p><p> She snatched the baby up and rocked it tightly. With her foot, she kicked at the hay, trying to cover the blood with a clean layer. The baby's mouth opened and closed on the cotton of her nightgown, rooting. </p><p> She knew what the baby wanted, needed, but she couldn't do it. It would make this real. </p><p> So she gave the baby her pinkie finger instead. She let the small, powerful jaws suckle, while she did what she had been taught to do in times of extreme stress; what she had been doing for months now. "Lord," she prayed, "please make this go away." </p><p><br> The rustle of chains awakened her. It was still dark out, but the dairy cows' internal schedule had them rising at their individual stalls, their bags hanging blue-veined and round with milk, like full moons caught between their legs. She was sore and tired, but knew she had to get out of the barn before the men arrived to do the milking. Glancing down, she realized that a miracle had come to pass: the blood-soaked hay was fresh now, except for a small stain beneath her own bottom. And the two things she'd been holding when she fell asleep -- the scissors and the newborn -- were gone. </p><p> She pulled herself to her feet and glanced toward the roof, awed and reverent. <i>"Denke,"</i> she whispered, and then she ran out of the barn into the shadows. </p><p><br> Like all other sixteen-year-old Amish boys, Levi Esch no longer attended school. He'd gone through the eighth grade and was now in that limbo between being a child and being old enough to be baptized into the Amish faith. In the interim, he was a hired hand for Aaron Fisher, who no longer had a son to help him work his dairy farm. Levi had gotten the job through the recommendation of his older cousin Samuel, who'd been apprenticing with the Fishers now for five years. And since everyone knew that Samuel was probably going to marry the Fishers' daughter soon and set up his own farm, it meant Levi would be getting a promotion. </p><p> His workday started at 4:00 a.m., as on all other dairy farms. It was still pitch-dark, and Levi could not see Samuel's buggy approach, but he could hear the faint jingle of tack and traces. He grabbed his flat-brimmed straw hat and ran out the door, then jumped onto the seat beside Samuel. </p><p> "Hi," he said breathlessly. </p><p> Samuel nodded at him but didn't turn, didn't speak. </p><p> "What's the matter?" Levi teased. "Katie wouldn't kiss you good-bye last night?" </p><p> Samuel scowled and cuffed Levi, sending his hat spinning into the back of the buggy. "Why don't you just shut up?" The wind whispered at the ragged edge of the cornfield as they drove on in silence. After a while, Samuel pulled the buggy into the Fishers' front yard. Levi scuffed the toe of his boot into the soft earth and waited for Samuel to put the horse out to pasture before they headed into the barn. </p><p> The lights used for milking were powered by a generator, as were the vacuum pumps hooked up to the teats of the cows. Aaron Fisher knelt beside one of the herd, spraying the udders with iodine solution and then wiping them dry with a page ripped from an old phone book. "Samuel, Levi," he greeted. </p><p> He did not tell them what to do, because by now they already knew. Samuel maneuvered the wheelbarrow beneath a silo and began to mix the feed. Levi shoveled out the manure behind each cow, periodically looking at Samuel and wishing he was already the senior farmhand. </p><p> The barn door opened, and Aaron's father ambled in. Elam Fisher lived in the <i>grossdawdi haus,</i> a small apartment attached to the main building. Although Elam helped out with the milking, Levi knew the unwritten rules: make sure the old man carried nothing heavy; keep him from taxing himself; and make him believe that Aaron couldn't do without him, although Aaron could have, any day of the week. "Boys," Elam boomed, then stopped in his tracks, his nose wrinkled above his long, white beard. "Why, we've had a calf." </p><p> Puzzled, Aaron stood. "No. I checked the pen." </p><p> Elam shook his head. "There's the smell of it, all the same." </p><p> "More like it's Levi, needing a bath," Samuel joked, emptying a fresh scoop of feed in front of the first cow. </p><p> As Samuel passed him with the wheelbarrow, Levi came up swinging and slipped on a slick of manure. He landed on his bottom in the ditch built to catch the refuse and set his jaw at Samuel's burst of laughter. </p><p> "Come on now," Aaron chided, although a grin tugged at his mouth. "Samuel, leave him be. Levi, I think Sarah left your spare clothes in the tack room." </p><p> Levi scrambled to his feet, his cheeks burning. He walked past Aaron, past the chalkboard with the annotated statistics on the cows due to calve, and turned into the small cubby that housed the blankets and bridles used for the farm's workhorses and mules. Like the rest of the barn, it was neat as a pin. Braided leather reins crossed the wall like spiderwebs, and shelves were stacked wit</p></p><h2>School Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice</h2><p>The premier resource for today&#39;s school nurses, School Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 3rd Edition is by school nurses for school nurses, who often can be the only healthcare provider in an educational setting.

In fact, we consume 33 billion dollars worth of pizza annually from the 63,873 pizzerias in America. That's a lot of slices.<br><br>This year's pizza centennial is a milestone laid claim to by Lombardi's Pizza, which opened its doors in New York in 1905. Celebrating this anniversary is Ed Levine's Pizza: A Slice of Heaven: The Ultimate Pizza Guide and Companion, in which Levine and some of America's best writers and cartoonists set out to answer every cosmic question involving this beloved food: Is Chicago pizza really more of a casserole? What makes New York pizza so good? Is the pizza in New Haven better than anything found in Naples? Is the best pizzeria in the world found in Phoenix, Arizona? What and where is the Pizza Belt? How good can homemade pizza be? Is there an American pizza aesthetic? How does one go about judging pizza? Is there such a thing as a good frozen pizza? <br><br>All these questions and more will be answered by Levine and Calvin Trillin, Ruth Reichl, Roy Blount, Jr., Arthur Schwartz, Mario Batali, Jeffrey Steingarten, and Eric Asimov, among others, who tackle the profound questions and never-ending debates that invariably arise whenever the subject of pizza is brought up in polite company.</p><p>Author and radio and television personality Ed Levine has been called the &#34;missionary of the delicious and the Homer of rugelach,&#34; by Ruth Reichl in the New York Times. He is a regular contributor to the New York Times, and is the author of New York Eats and New York Eats (More), which was a finalist for the Julia Child Cookbook Award.Having consumed 1,000 slices of pizza in one year, across 20 states, Canada and Italy, Levine certainly possesses a firsthand, encyclopedic knowledge of the dish. But in his attempt to create "the ultimate guide and companion," he has constructed an unwieldy book with too many toppings. It is at once an anthology of reprinted essays and articles, a collection of celebrity mini-memoirs, a history of pizza both ancient and modern, and a collection of capsule reviews of dozens of pizza purveyors (including classic pizzerias, larger chains and staples of the frozen-food aisle). For the essays, Levine (<i>New York Eats</i>) raids the stables of the <i>New York Times</i> and Cond� Nast on the East Coast, and culls from various Pacific coast journalists in the West. Highlights include an amusing piece by Jeffrey Steingarten on how to create a 700-degree heat source at home, and Levine's own seminal 2002 <i>Times</i> piece, "The State of the Slice." But Nora Ephron's memory of her "first time" eating pizza is disappointingly brief and hurried, and actor Ed Norton's 79-word cameo appearance in a paragraph about stromboli feels out of place. New York gets the most attention with reviews from all five boroughs, Westchester and Long Island (an eating trip to Italy merits just 10 pages). Levine at least ends on a high note, profiling the top six pie makers he encountered. B&amp;w photos. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I wanted to pack heat and smoke unfiltered cigarettes and give them long-legged dames in mink stoles the squinty-eyed once-over. I longed to chase villains, right wrongs, and restore the peace.</p><br><br><p>Upon surviving into manhood, I discovered the black and comedic irony that is every gumshoe&#x2019;s existential plight, the secret that dime novels and black-and-white movies always elide: each clue our intrepid detective deciphers, each mystery he unravels, each crime he solves, makes the world an unhappier place. I got smart and became a gangster instead. More money, more women, and better clothes. Much less in the way of mystery. As for the misery quotient? Basically a wash.</p><br><br><p>Became a gangster. There&#x2019;s a mouthful. How I wound up hitting for the far north division of the Outfit is a woeful saga. The story of how I escaped that life is no less grim, but it&#x2019;s a hell of a lot shorter.</p><br><br><p>The Outfit flew me first class from Anchorage to Nome on a working vacation.</p><br><br><p>Boss had wrapped his arm around my shoulder.</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Isaiah,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Do me a favor, son? Take in the frozen vistas, photograph the northern lights, maybe crack a few heads. See ya in a couple months.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>Perhaps not those exact words, but close. What he really meant was snoop around and make sure everything was copacetic behind the scenes.</p><br><br><p>The gig didn&#x2019;t appeal to my sensibilities. Nome isn&#x2019;t a premier post by any means. In fact, the suits in Anchorage and Chicago treat the town like a Mafia penal colony. Two types get sent to the deep freeze&#x2014;guys with specialist talent and ne&#x2019;er-do-wells. We&#x2019;re talking malcontents, sadists, and screwups. No, I didn&#x2019;t relish the -assignment, short-term or not. However, I understood my place. A polite request from the headman was no request at all.</p><br><br><p>Upon landing, I reported to Vitale Night, a local mob potentate in charge of tundra as far as the eye could see. A medium-built guy; angular, from his hawkish nose and bony hands to his sharp knees. Shiny, graying hair and tailored duds&#x2014;a Sinatra wannabe.</p><br><br><p>Night had risen through the ranks in Chicago as the premier button man of the generation prior to my own. Quick on the draw as a Wild West gunfighter with a pile of bodies to his credit. I witnessed him in action at the shooting range. Fast wasn&#x2019;t really an adequate description. The pistol seemed to teleport from its holster to his hand as he emptied a magazine through a bull&#x2019;s-eye the diameter of a nickel.</p><br><br><p>A man without compunction was the book on Vitale Night. It&#x2019;s difficult to come by a higher compliment in the mob. Why the powers that be shipped him to Alaska presented a mystery. Rumors abounded&#x2014;he&#x2019;d whacked somebody without permission; he&#x2019;d stolen the wrong captain&#x2019;s mistress; he&#x2019;d looked funny at a boss. Could have been any of those trespasses, or none.</p><br><br><p>Lately, Night handled various rackets between Nome and Prudhoe Bay. Drugs, guns, gambling, prostitution; anything to improve the morale of lonely commercial fishermen and oil field roughnecks as they toiled in the Land of the Midnight Sun. The Outfit loved Alaska&#x2014;wide-open shipping lanes, among the finest weed in North America, and a never-ending glut of petroleum money that eventually flowed into their pockets. Maintaining a successful Alaska operation was a matter of identifying men who could handle extremes of light and dark and perpetually savage weather.</p><br><br><p>My task? Intimidate a few of Night&#x2019;s underperforming subordinates so he didn&#x2019;t need to lower himself or muck around with hurt feelings. Family relationships are petty and complicated&#x2014;doesn&#x2019;t matter what family you&#x2019;re talking about.</p><br><br><p>When you needed a whip hand, you sent Isaiah Coleridge. I&#x2019;d set the gold standard. Those movies by Albert Broccoli about the world-famous spy? In every flick there&#x2019;s a sinister, powerfully built dude in a nice suit lurking at the margins. He kills people who annoy his boss, the archvillian. I was that dude.</p><br><br><p>The first few weeks in Nome were smooth. The bozos I&#x2019;d come to frighten took a gander at my game face and straightened their acts out in a hurry. Easy money. Mostly, we played cards and spent a sizable chunk of our evenings boozing at one of a dozen taverns. I got close to the crew, especially Night&#x2019;s second fiddle, Tony Becchi (aka Tony Flowers), a potbellied old-school gangster. Old-school as in Dark Ages.</p><br><br><p>Like myself, Tony Flowers guest-starred in this particular drama. Chicago had decided Night required the talents of an older, stable gangster; not permanently, just for a year or two. Originally from Florida, Tony F hated Illinois weather. Well, he hated Alaska winter a damned sight worse. I allowed him to believe the two of us shared this sentiment. He made the assumption due to me being half Maori. We established a running gag:</p><br><br><p>What the fuck is a Maori doing in Alaska? he&#x2019;d say.</p><br><br><p>Freezing my ass off, I&#x2019;d reply. What&#x2019;s the forecast?</p><br><br><p>Partly shitty this morning, intermittently shitty this afternoon, and mostly shitty tonight.</p><br><br><p>Funny thing, I&#x2019;d come to ask myself the same question with increasing frequency: what was I doing here? Instead of heeding that instinct, which I came to acknowledge as the angel on my right shoulder, I downed another shot and waited for it to leave me in peace.</p><br><br><p>Kept right on that way until it was too late.</p><br><br><p>TWO</p><br><br><p>The universe went sideways on a skiff in the Chukchi Sea. My increasingly changeable nature had given plenty of signs. I should&#x2019;ve seen it coming, should&#x2019;ve been wise to the demands of my soul.</p><br><br><p>The whole charade began to fall apart the day Vitale Night decreed a handful of his crew would accompany him on a short flight to a private lodge near Kotzebue. He refused to explain the occasion and merely smirked when I inquired. You don&#x2019;t ask a captain twice; you keep mum and wait to see what happens next.</p><br><br><p>What happened next is we got into a twin-prop passenger plane and zipped north to a rustic hunting lodge on an isolated shore. I found it spartan, albeit classy enough. Log construction as one would expect, and decorated with polar bear heads and photographs of various Popes and the Rat Pack.</p><br><br><p>Vitale Night threw a righteous bash. He&#x2019;d brought a case of champagne and plenty of blow. Several snow bunnies entertained the company of hard cases. I brooded in a corner and drank far too much. In the morning I staggered downstairs to witness Night and Tony F unpacking rifles and an array of skinning knives. The men grinned at me and nudged each other as they laid their implements on a bunting cloth spread across the dining room table. They wore wool shirts, wool pants, and heavy-duty snow boots. Their sneers foretold impending awfulness. It remained to be seen what form that awfulness would assume.</p><br><br><p>Vitale Night checked the scope on a rifle.</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Coleridge. I hear you&#x2019;re a hunter.&#x201d; He centered the bore on my head and dry-fired. &#x201c;Christ, don&#x2019;t scowl like that. You&#x2019;re scarin&#x2019; the womenfolk. I&#x2019;m just yankin&#x2019; your chain.&#x201d; He and Tony F shared a belly laugh.</p><br><br><p>I walked over to the bar, grabbed a bottle of Knob Creek, and poured myself a tall glass for breakfast. The bottle got dangerously low before the all-terrain vehicle arrived.</p><br><br><p>A half dozen of us bundled into the cramped compartment and were driven out onto the fast ice. The ATV clanged along on metal treads that chewed through blue-white pressure ridges. Clouds gathered, low and heavy, and merged with lighter fog. Eventually, pack ice began to separate in open water. A long wooden skiff piloted by a local awaited our arrival. Everybody pulled anoraks over their winter coats and piled aboard the skiff. Twin Evinrude motors barked and the pilot sailed us into the briny mist.</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s waiting for us?&#x201d; I said to Tony Flowers.</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Herd a walrus,&#x201d; he yelled over the motors&#x2019; roar. &#x201c;They winter on icebergs near the coast. Gonna bag us a shitpot of ivory!&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>The sun ate through the clouds.</p><br><br><p>Images from that afternoon will score my memory until death sweeps the slate bare: the iceberg, stepped like an abstract&nbsp;sculpture of a ziggurat and dotted with drowsy walruses who had no fear of approaching humans; Night, Tony F, and two other shooters blazing away as the skiff rocked and rolled; another hunter gathering a brace of machetes in anticipation of the mass beheadings; the squalls of dying animals; and streams of hot red blood hissing over the edge of the berg and into black seawater. The stench of terror and shit and smoke as if that piece of the wilderness had become a portable -abattoir.</p><br><br><p>One of the men filmed the slaughter with a Handycam. He whooped narratively.</p><br><br><p>I did not consciously decide to act. Had that been the case, I might have hesitated&#x2014;Vitale Night was too fast and too mad. To defy him was to risk a hideous death. I did what I did out of instinct, a sympathetic response from the animal in my hindbrain.</p><br><br><p>Vitale Night and I stood side by side near the bow. He gestured to&nbsp;me for a fresh magazine. In retrospect, I believe he meant to demonstrate dominance by reducing my status to that of his personal spear-carrier. He reloaded slowly and deliberately, feet braced against the rocking of the boat. Completely vulnerable. He raised his head to survey the action and I chopped his throat with the edge of my hand. Night&#x2019;s tinted glasses flew. He made a sound like steam whistling in the flue of a kettle and dropped to his knees. Take a man&#x2019;s air, you take all the fight right out of him and I don&#x2019;t care if he jumps into both pant legs at the same time in the morning.</p><br><br><p>I picked up his rifle and pointed it in the general direction of Tony Flowers.</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Hey, Tony. Better call it a day and head home. Vitale needs a doctor.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>None of the crew knew which way to jump. Night&#x2019;s men were as confused as the bawling walruses flopping around the iceberg. The Mafia Handbook doesn&#x2019;t cover the situation.</p><br><br><p>Tony Flowers carefully set his weapon aside and defused what might&#x2019;ve escalated into a shoot-out in the middle of the Chukchi Sea.</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Yeah, yeah. He don&#x2019;t look so hot.&#x201d; He smiled a sickly, hateful smile.</p><br><br><p>After we reached shore, I rode in the plane back to Nome with him and Vitale Night. Night slumped in a rear seat, eyes squeezed shut, face gone gray. He gurgled the way a baby does. Tony F clasped his hand and whispered what I assume were promises of vengeance.</p><br><br><p>As we taxied into the Nome airport, a bitter wind howled off Norton Sound. Snow fell thick and fast. Right before he climbed into the ambulance with his boss, Tony F finally made eye contact.</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Isaiah&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You just fucked yourself royal. Why?&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>I had no answer for him. How could I explain in words he&#x2019;d remotely understand? Despite everything, despite the evil in my heart, I never was a hunter of dumb beasts.</p><br><br><p>THREE</p><br><br><p>It was me in the chair this time.</p><br><br><p>Vitale Night&#x2019;s boys took no chances. A guy with my reputation? You didn&#x2019;t screw around. Nope, you hired a sexy cocktail waitress to slip under my guard and deliver the sting. Horse tranquilizer mixed into a scotch and soda followed by a midnight ride to the old Nome cannery district. If you were smart, you hog-tied me, beat me, bled me, softened me up for the main event. No surprises, no opportunities to turn the tables, no second act. Curtains, baby.</p><br><br><p>I took a measure of morbid pride in their professionalism and their fear. Tony Flowers and a couple of goons stripped me to my boxers. They chained me in the center of a ten-by-twenty concrete subbasement cell. I&#x2019;m a big man, so the fellows used a lot of chain.</p><br><br><p>The chair was solid wrought iron and looked as if it had been unbolted from the deck of a trawler. Dirty fluorescent bulbs pulsed overhead. The chamber reeked of bleach and mildew. The faint muddy stench of seawater seeped through the foundation. -Mid-winter and meat locker chilly, although I&#x2019;d stopped noticing the finer details after Tony F and his sidekicks traded turns dealing blows to my jaw.</p><br><br><p>Goon number one was a broad-shouldered lad with fists like bricks. Not quite my size, but ripped from pumping iron at the firehouse rec center. An indefatigable brute&#x2014;his umpteenth punch struck with the same bone-crushing force as the first had. I figured he&#x2019;d be going places if he lived long enough. I winked through the gore at the kid to remind him that nothing in this life is guaranteed. Me being Exhibit A.</p><br><br><p>He said, &#x201c;Dude&#x2019;s still got jokes.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Everybody&#x2019;s a hard case until you get to their balls,&#x201d; Tony Flowers said.</p><br><br><p>A special word about Tony F. He didn&#x2019;t look like much in his patented cardinal red tracksuit and wire-rimmed glasses. He&#x2019;d killed plenty of people, however. His specialty lay with knives, drills, and similar toys. His birth name was Tony Becchi. He came to be known as Tony Flowers because once upon a time if you saw Tony in his professional capacity it meant flowers on your grave. He&#x2019;d matured into a shrewd businessman. Few wiseguys knew more about gambling or coke than Tony F. That&#x2019;s why he could afford to hump a procession of trophy girlfriends, drive last year&#x2019;s model Jag, and blow so much dough at the bar every weekend.</p><br><br><p>And here he stood in a frozen cell orchestrating a beating that would bring him neither fame nor fortune. He had to assume it would be his turn one day.</p><br><br><p>Reversals of fortune happen fast. Meteor streaking from the sky fast. Two days ago, I&#x2019;d eaten New York steak, sipped Cristal, and taken my brothers in crime to the cleaners at our weekly poker game in the back room of the clubhouse. Two days ago, I was a man of status. Respected and feared by friends and enemies; doted upon by lackeys and subordinates. Not the king, nowhere near, yet significantly more than a mere supernumerary in the venerable blood opera.</p><br><br><p>Tonight, I was a prisoner: drugged, stripped, tortured, and well on the way to becoming a corpse. I intended to face my approaching doom with a smidgen of equanimity. Fortune and ruin, life and death, all the important things, are balanced upon the razor&#x2019;s edge. Yes, the chickens had come home to roost. In this business they always do. Actions have consequences and my fate could be put down to physics. I regretted nothing. Nothing except the perpetual bad weather that had socked in all the flights out of town and kept me stranded, vulnerable to reprisal.</p></p><h2>Lars Bolander&#39;s Scandinavian Design</h2><p>Clean, elegant lines, delicate color schemes, well-proportioned, light-filled spaces, and natural materi�als&#x2014;the hallmarks of Scandinavian design are unmistak�able. As the trend in residential design continues to move toward pared-down, comfortably elegant, environmentally friendly homes, the Scandinavian aesthetic has become a global influence in interior design. Lars Bolander, one of Sweden&#x2019;s foremost interior designers, has been creating the Scandinavian look in homes all over the world for decades. In this impressively illustrated volume, he and author Heather Smith MacIsaac, a former editor of <i>House &amp; Garden </i>magazine, share their expert knowledge of the very best in Scandinavian design, past and present, offer�ing guidance on how to achieve the Scandinavian look, incorporate the trademark elements into any decor, and mix and match traditional and modern, humble and grand.<p></p><p></p><p><br></p> &nbsp;<p></p> <b>Praise for Lars Bolander's Scandinavian Design:<p></p></b><br> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> &nbsp;&#x201c;A private, exclusive tour of the best of Scandinavian design. . . .

In this book, he brings that world of style vividly to life with images of some of the most magical and inspiring environments to be found there, from the light-dappled elegance of Gustavian interiors to the inventive purity of the very best in contemporary architecture.&#x201d; <br> ~ Hamish Bowles<br> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> &#x201c;Lars Bolander&#x2019;s handsome and intelligent book tells the story of Scandinavian design and its influence&#x2014;in the past, in the present, and leading into the twenty-first century. A product of a northern world separated to a great extent from Europe, Scandinavian design looked to the styles of the French court in the eighteenth century, but developed its own style with an adaptive simplicity that has given it a place unto itself in the history of design, as beautifully visualized on the pages of this book.&#x201d; ~ David Easton<br> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> &#x201c;Lars has the magic formula for combining the sophisticated Gustavian style with the rustic charm of the Scandinavian countryside.

Even before he ever went online, Robinson had forged a life consistent with a killer's profile. Despite being fired and arrested numerous times for fraud and theft, he wriggled out of serious trouble thanks to a smooth charm and cunning intelligence. For decades, Robinson's more sinister activities escaped the notice of nearly everyone, including law enforcement and, incredibly, his own wife. But what makes Robinson's story, as told here by John Douglas and Stephen Singular, uniquely disturbing is the presence of the World Wide Web and the ease with which a murderer can use it. Online, Robinson frequented chat rooms and sites dedicated to the lurid underground world of bondage and sadomasochism. In this anonymous space, he was free to assume honey-tongued new identities that he used to lure women, especially those in vulnerable situations, to Kansas with promises of employment, protection, or sex. Their subsequent disappearances were explained away with letters that appeared to be written by the victims but were actually typed by the killer on pieces of paper the women had previously signed. Ultimately, dogged law enforcement officials were able to catch up with Robinson and put him on trial after finding gruesome evidence of his deeds. While they are skilled true-crime writers, Douglas and Singular occasionally stray into hyperbole, which is far from necessary given the elements already present in Robinson&#x2019;s horrifying story. It is likely that any reader will walk a little more warily by their computer after reading this book and getting an idea of who might be hiding behind a given nickname. <i>--John Moe</i><b>John Douglas</b> is the bestselling coauthor of the nonfiction <i>Mindhunter</i> series.

For centuries, sticklers the world over have donned the cloak of authority to control the way people use words. Now this sensational new book strikes back to defend the fascinating, real-life diversity of this most basic human faculty.<br><br>With the erudite yet accessible style that marks his work as a journalist, Robert Lane Greene takes readers on a rollicking tour around the world, illustrating with vivid anecdotes the role language beliefs play in shaping our identities, for good and ill. Beginning with literal myths, from the Tower of Babel to the bloody origins of the word &#x201c;shibboleth,&#x201d; Greene shows how language &#x201c;experts&#x201d; went from myth-making to rule-making and from building cohesive communities to building modern nations. From the notion of one language&#x2019;s superiority to the common perception that phrases like &#x201c;It&#x2019;s me&#x201d; are &#x201c;bad English,&#x201d; linguistic beliefs too often define &#x201c;us&#x201d; and distance &#x201c;them,&#x201d; supporting class, ethnic, or national prejudices. In short: What we hear about language is often really about the politics of identity.<br><br>Governments foolishly try to police language development (the French Academy), nationalism leads to the violent suppression of minority languages (Kurdish and Basque), and even Americans fear that the most successful language in world history (English) may be threatened by increased immigration. These false language beliefs are often tied to harmful political ends and can lead to the violation of basic human rights. Conversely, political involvement in language can sometimes prove beneficial, as with the Zionist&nbsp; revival of Hebrew or our present-day efforts to provide education in foreign languages essential to business, diplomacy, and intelligence. And yes, standardized languages play a crucial role in uniting modern societies.<br><br>As this fascinating book shows, everything we&#x2019;ve been taught to think about language may not be wrong&#x2014;but it is often about something more than language alone. <i>You Are What You Speak </i>will certainly get people talking.</p><p><b>Robert Lane Greene </b>is an international correspondent for <i>The Economist,</i> and his writing has appeared in <i>The New York Times,</i> on Slate, and in other publications.

Forty-two thousand Ephraimites were killed at that time.<br><br>&#x2014;Judges 12<br><br>The power of language in the human imagination is illustrated by one of the best-known stories of Genesis. Men, in their arrogance, began to build a tower that would reach to Heaven, rivaling even the glory of God. God, who admits he is &#x201c;a jealous God,&#x201d; is not amused and resolves to take action. But what does he do? Does he smite the tower builders, as he does a host of other unfortunates throughout the Old Testament? Does he send an unforgettable visible sign, like the writing on King Belshazzar&#x2019;s wall or the pillar of fire that led the Israelites through the desert?<br><br>These things, well in God&#x2019;s power, would have been more direct ways of impeding the arrogant tower builders. But instead, God makes a decision that will have lasting consequences, deciding to &#x201c;confound the language of all the earth.&#x201d; Before the birth of historical linguistics, the Babel story explained how the world came to speak a multitude of languages. Adam and Eve presumably spoke the same one. Genesis tells us how this happy state of affairs ended and we got Akkadian, Hittite, and Hebrew.<br><br>But the more interesting part of this story is what it shows about the power of language in the eyes of its authors. God worries that with one common language for humankind, &#x201c;nothing will be restrained from them.&#x201d; This, remember, is God: he can flood the world, rain frogs on the Egyptians, turn rivers to blood, and raise the dead. Communication through language must be mighty indeed to worry the Supreme Being into doing something about it.<br><br>The epigraph beginning this chapter may be the first recorded, but certainly not the last, story of language differences getting violent. Militant Protestants and Catholics distinguished one another in Northern Ireland in part by the modern-day equivalent of &#x201c;shibboleth&#x201d;: Protestants pronounce the eighth letter of the alphabet &#x201c;aitch,&#x201d; while Catholics say &#x201c;haitch.&#x201d; Minor differences in the Serb, Croat, and Bosniak pronunciations of the language once known as Serbo-Croat were played up by ethnic nationalists in the run-up to the wars in the former Yugoslavia. (The former Yugoslavs have abandoned &#x201c;Serbo-Croat,&#x201d; now insisting they speak Serbian, Bosnian, and Croat.) And after a horrifying multiday spree of shootings and bombings in Mumbai in December 2008, Indian police insisted that Pakistanis were behind the massacres. Though the killers had attempted to appear Indian, Indian authorities noted spelling mistakes in their letter of demands. Pakistanis retorted that certain pronunciations&#x2014;&#x201d;zoror&#x201d; versus &#x201c;jurur&#x201d;&#x2014;marked the terrorists as Indians. The two nuclear-armed rival countries mobilized troops amid talk of war, as the shibboleth appeared again in its most life-or-death form.<br><br>If language is enough to get God himself involved and a terrifically powerful marker of who belongs to what tribe, we would expect humans to try to control it by raising one language above all others&#x2014;and sometimes even restricting who can use it and when and how.<br><br>Hebrew died out as a standard language almost two thousand years ago. As Aramaic became more common in the ancient Middle East, Jews began using the holy language of the Torah mainly for religious purposes. Hebrew was effectively dead for those millennia, until Eliezer Ben Yehuda began the revival of it in Palestine. But the idea of using the holy tongue for scolding a child or ordering food offended the most Orthodox Jews, who resisted violently. It is those same ultrareligious types who don&#x2019;t even speak the name of their god. Modern scholars can only guess (from the Hebrew text, which omitted vowels) that the Jewish deity&#x2019;s name is &#x201c;Yahweh.&#x201d; When reading the Torah aloud, religious Jews replace YHWH, the four letters of God&#x2019;s name, with adonai, &#x201c;Lord.&#x201d; Elsewhere, they simply refer to him as haShem: the name. Jews are famous for revering their holy books; less famously but just as fervently, they revere the language itself, too. They once revered it so much that they resisted its revival: to see it spoken in the street would inevitably mean seeing it profaned.<br><br>Judaism&#x2019;s Abrahamic rival took the opposite path: not restricting the language of religion but flinging it far and wide. The archangel Gabriel&#x2019;s first word to the prophet Muhammad was Iqra&#x2019;!, &#x201c;Recite!&#x201d; Muhammad took dictation of the Qur&#x2019;an from Heaven in his native language, Arabic, then spoken only in the Arabian Peninsula. From there, he and his successors spread the new religion of Islam spectacularly in just a few centuries. And Arabic was the essential language of Islam. So important was the original language of the text that true Muslims had to read it only in Arabic. (The Qur&#x2019;an itself states, in God&#x2019;s own words, &#x201c;And if We had sent this as a Quran in a foreign language other than Arabic, they would have said: &#x2018;Why are not its Verses explained in detail in our language? What! A Book not in Arabic and the Messenger an Arab?&#x2019; &#x201d; [41:44])<br><br>The religious role of the language helped Arabize the lands from Morocco to Iraq. Pious Muslims the rest of the world over must know Arabic to read their holy book too. Any translation is by definition inauthentic&#x2014;in 2009 an Afghan court upheld the twenty-year prison sentence of a man who had translated the Qur&#x2019;an into the local dialect of Persian without the Arabic text alongside. This means that hundreds of millions of Muslims&#x2014;a majority of the world&#x2019;s Muslims, in fact&#x2014;can access their religion today only in a foreign language.<br><br>Different though the Jewish and Islamic approaches are, both faiths revere their sacred language. Being a true Jew means mastering the Hebrew language in order to interact with the texts and learning Aramaic to read Judaism&#x2019;s lengthy exegeses on the Bible. Meanwhile, Arabs so venerate the language of the Qur&#x2019;an that one of the highest honorifics in Islam is hafiz: one who has memorized the entire book.<br><br>This is a book about language, not religion, so why all this talk about the sacred? The interplay between religion and language illustrates a core point: language is tightly bound with the things we hold dearest. It makes us human; if united through language, we can be as great as God. But language also defines us as religious tribes: we are those who read the holy texts in their original sacred languages, and you are not. Finally, religious-linguistic taboos reveal some of our magical thinking: using a word, the name of God, risks the sin of taking that holy name in vain. Jews avoid it entirely. Christians make sure that when they are angry they say &#x201c;Jiminy cricket!&#x201d; or &#x201c;Jeez!&#x201d; The fact that God made this one of only ten commandments tells us something.<br><br>The point is that even today, we both worship the power of language and approach it with a dose of fear. People believe that words matter intensely. They often think that the way they speak is inimitable and superior, and that their language is the clearest outward sign of who they are. These two beliefs taken together form a secular religion of language today&#x2014;and make language an inviting target for mythmaking and manipulation. Often these myths come from those who care most about language, great writers and wordsmiths who should really know better.<br><br>For example, did you know that the Arabs have six thousand words for camels and camel equipment; that &#x201c;muscatel&#x201d; is an Italian word meaning &#x201c;wine with flies in it&#x201d;; and that the Maoris of New Zealand have thirty-five words for dung?<br><br>Actually, you couldn&#x2019;t know any of these things, because verbs such as &#x201c;know&#x201d; (and &#x201c;learn&#x201d; and &#x201c;discover&#x201d; and the like) require the following statements to be true. None of these statements is. And they all come from the same source: the entertaining and wide-ranging journalist Bill Bryson, in his book The Mother Tongue. This book, meant to be an entertaining but serious look at the English language, begins with an introduction so packed with manifest silliness that it makes for an excellent illustration of why smart people believe so many odd things about language.<br><br>The Mother Tongue first takes the reader on a magical mystery tour of foreign languages. Bryson says that &#x201c;we tend to regard other people&#x2019;s languages as we regard their cultures&#x2014;with ill-hidden disdain.&#x201d; Too true. Unfortunately, Bryson proves himself right with a series of stories that should have set off his own too-bizarre-to-be-true detector. &#x201c;In Japanese, the word for foreigner means &#x2018;stinking of foreign hair&#x2019;,&#x201d; he tells us. No. Gaikokujin means foreign-country-person. &#x201c;To the Czechs, a Hungarian is &#x2018;a pimple.&#x2019; &#x201d; No, to the Czechs, a Hungarian is a Mad&#x2019;ar, related to the Hungarians&#x2019; name for themselves, Magyars. (A less-common variant, uhersky, looks a bit like uher, &#x201c;pimple,&#x201d; but only coincidentally.)<br><br>Bryson goes on, &#x201c;The French, for instance, cannot distinguish between house and home, between mind and brain, between man and gentleman.&#x201d; All three claims are wrong. &#x201c;Mind&#x201d; is esprit, brain is cerveau, and the French can certainly tell them apart. Man is homme, but the French have the (English-derived calque) gentilhomme for a well-bred man, as well as the word monsieur for situations such as &#x201c;The gentleman would like a cup of coffee.&#x201d; Maison does mean both house and home, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean the French &#x201c;cannot distinguish&#x201d; them any more than it means that Americans &#x201c;cannot distinguish&#x201d; &#x201c;house,&#x201d; a dwelling, from &#x201c;house,&#x201d; a kind of electronic dance music.<br><br>The &#x201c;X people have no word for&#x201d; trope is a staple of curious but only half-informed language writing. It is based on the expectation that a foreign lexicon is mysteriously different if one word in that language equates to two or more of ours (maison for &#x201c;house&#x201d; and &#x201c;home&#x201d;) or if we need two English words or more to translate a foreign one. Bryson says we have no word for the Danish hygge, then goes on to tell us exactly what it means: &#x201c;instantly satisfying and cozy&#x201d; (though he&#x2019;s confused parts of speech: hygge is a noun, and so it&#x2019;s &#x201c;coziness&#x201d;). Since we have no word for the French sang-froid or Spanish macho, Bryson says, &#x201c;we must borrow the term or do without the sentiment.&#x201d; Really? Was there no way to think about cool under pressure or swaggering masculinity, before those words entered English? Bryson is indulging here in a pop form of the theory called &#x201c;Whorfianism&#x201d;: the notion that without a word for something, you can&#x2019;t think about it.<br><br>What about thirty-five Maori words for &#x201c;dung&#x201d;? I don&#x2019;t know Maori, so I found a dictionary, which included three: haumuti, hamuti, and tuutae. &#x201c;Piece of dung&#x201d; also came in with parakaeto and paratutae. Perhaps in every dialect of every Maori, including slang words and euphemisms and animal- related terms, and throwing in adjectives and verbs related to it, you could, at a stretch, turn up thirty-five. But how easy would it be in English? Polite words would be dung, fertilizer, manure, feces, stool, defecation; euphemisms would include poo, poop, doo-doo, and number two; animal terms would include cow patty, buffalo chip, rabbit pellet, and guano; semi-taboo words would include turd and crap; silly words would encompass malarkey and caca; and let&#x2019;s not forget good old shit.<br><br>What of &#x201c;muscatel&#x201d; being Italian for &#x201c;wine with flies in it&#x201d;? Not remotely, though Bryson may have been misled by the fact that mosca means &#x201c;fly&#x201d; in Italian. If you want a fun fact for muscatel, here&#x2019;s one: the name comes from muscat, a type of grape. &#x201c;Muscat&#x201d; shares an etymology with &#x201c;musk.&#x201d; And &#x201c;musk&#x201d;? It comes from Middle English muske, which comes from Middle French musc, which comes from Late Latin muscus, from Late Greek moschos, from Middle Persian mu?sk-, from Sanskrit muska, meaning&#x2014;wait for it&#x2014;&#x201c;testicle.&#x201d; And muska comes from the diminuitive of m�us, meaning &#x201c;mouse.&#x201d; So Sanskrit speakers many, many years ago euphemized &#x201c;testicle&#x201d; as &#x201c;little mouse,&#x201d; and through many years of natural language change, the word &#x201c;musk&#x201d; evolved along one track and the words &#x201c;muscat&#x201d; and &#x201c;muscatel&#x201d; developed from another. This doesn&#x2019;t mean that &#x201c;muscatel&#x201d; means &#x201c;testicle wine&#x201d; or &#x201c;wine with mice in it&#x201d; or any such ridiculousness. It means that &#x201c;muscatel&#x201d; shares a distant past with Sanskrit words for &#x201c;testicle&#x201d; and &#x201c;mouse&#x201d;&#x2014;a story just as interesting as Bryson&#x2019;s, with the virtue of being true.<br><br>I can&#x2019;t resist one last Bryson foreign-language story, perhaps the most preposterous of all: &#x201c;In Cantonese, hae means &#x2018;yes.&#x2019; But with a fractional change of pitch, it also describes the female pudenda. The resulting scope for confusion can safely be left to the imagination.&#x201d; This requires a tremendous imagination indeed. I have tried and totally failed to imagine a context in which both &#x201c;yes&#x201d; and &#x201c;female pudenda&#x201d; might both be appropriate responses to the same question and hilarity could ensue from the wrong understanding. In any case, the &#x201c;fractional change of pitch&#x201d; Bryson describes is one of the Chinese &#x201c;tones,&#x201d; rising, falling, level, or dipping pitch. These tones make one Chinese word as different from another as &#x201c;bit&#x201d; and &#x201c;beet&#x201d; are in English, and the Chinese have no trouble distinguishing them.<br><br>Somewhere out there, a Chinese journalist-cum-humorist may be writing &#x201c;In English one word means &#x2018;cotton or cotton-blend cloths used to cover a bed.&#x2019; But with a fractional change in vowel quality, it means excrement. The resulting scope for confusion can safely be left to the imagination.&#x201d; Except how often do you really confuse &#x201c;sheet&#x201d; and &#x201c;shit,&#x201d; even when, as many foreigners do, they are pronounced similarly?<br><br>Having exoticized&#x2014;call it amiable bullsheet&#x2014;every foreign language he has ever heard a tall tale about, Bryson moves on to English, the real subject of The Mother Tongue. Here the talented writer is on firmer ground, and by and large the book is an accurate and enjoyable popular history. But first he feels compelled to set up the unique story of English with a list of supposedly mind-bending quirks:<br><br>English is full of booby traps for the unwary foreigner. . . . Imagine being a foreigner and having to learn that in English one tells a lie but the truth. . . . The complexities of the English language are such that even native speakers cannot always communicate effectively. . . . English also has a distinctive capacity to extract maximum work from a word by making it do double duty as both a noun and a verb . . . drink, fight, fire, sleep, run. . . . There is an occasional tendency in English, particularly in academic and political circles, to resort to waffle and jargon . . . one of the great curses of modern English.<br><br>Which of these things couldn&#x2019;t be said of French or German, or a vast number of other languages for that matter?<br><br>That is quite enough picking on Bill Bryson. He is, after all, more of a commentator and a humorist than a serious journalist. His writing is laugh-out-loud funny, he has remarkable powers of observation, and he is obviously a highly intelligent man. But being a humorist doesn&#x2019;t get him off the hook; he wrote not just The Mother Tongue but several other books trying to entertainingly teach people things they did not know about English. Humorist or not, Bryson really wants to share the things he &#x201c;knows.&#x201d; The problem is, as the nineteenth-century American writer Josh Billings wrote (though it&#x2019;s often put into the mouth of Mark Twain), it&#x2019;s not the things people ...</p><h2>Wise Thoughts for Every Day: On God, Love, Spirit, and Living a Good Life</h2><p>A treasury of wisdom culled from the preeminent writer&#39;s wide-ranging readings in philosophy and religion, as well as his own meditations, shares his beliefs about spirituality and living the good life, in a volume designed to be read daily that explores such themes as passion, truth, and the blessings of love. 35,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Leo Tolstoy</b> (1828-1910), a giant of world literature, is the author of many classics, including <i>War and Peace</i> and <i>Anna Karenina</i>.</p><h2>The Mosaic Artist's Bible: 300 Traditional &amp; Contemporary Designs</h2><p>The Mosaic Artist&#39;s Bible is an invaluable sourcebook for both novice and experienced mosaicists, featuring more than 200 themed, traceable motifs and a wealth of information and instruction.</p><p>Mosaicists of every level will delight in this new sourcebook, featuring page after page of inspiring motifs.

He would have been 65 this year. A quarter of a century after his death, the questions remain: what was John Lennon really like, what drove him to the heights of creativity and the depths of despair, and why do his music and message still resonate for millions around the world? Now acclaimed broadcast journalist and author Larry Kane uncovers the mysteries of Lennon's life and implodes the myths surrounding it. Kane definitely has the right credentials for the job. He was the only American reporter who traveled in the Beatles' official entourage to every stop on their history-making first American tours, and he stayed in touch with Lennon until an assassin ended the former Beatle's life. <i>Lennon Revealed</i> is filled with revelations about John Lennon's path from public glory to personal destruction, and ultimately to the inspiring rebirth that defines a triumph of the spirit. Drawing on extensive personal accounts and extraordinary new interviews with more than 50 confidants and experts-most notably, with Yoko Ono-Kane brings the reader closer than ever to the man who, in life and in death, has had a singular impact on humanity. Kane also provides stunning new information about Lennon's relationships with Ono, his childhood soulmate Stuart Sutcliffe, his lover May Pang, and Beatles manager Brian Epstein. The book includes an exclusive DVD featuring the final filmed interview with Lennon and Paul McCartney, conducted by Larry Kane in 1968. Brief clips from this famous interview have appeared in just a few places, including the official documentary <i>Imagine</i>.</p><p><b>Larry Kane</b> is the dean of Philadelphia television news anchors,&#x201d; having had a 45-year career covering domestic and world events. He previously wrote an account of his tour experiences with the Beatles in his book <i>Ticket to Ride</i>. Kane lives in southeastern Pennsylvania.Launching his career as a reporter on the Beatles&#39; first two tours of America, Larry Kane continued to follow the group throughout their career--as evidenced by the bonus DVD, on which Kane, looking every bit the &#34;straight&#34; sixties reporter, interviews a fully psychedelicized--and typically cheeky--John Lennon and Paul McCartney in 1968. Coming on the heels of Kane&#39;s previous opus, TICKET TO RIDE, this book focuses on the most charismatic member of the band, and the one Kane had the closest personal relationship with. As the title suggests, the book attempts to examine the man behind the superstar facade. As a TV professional, Kane seldom slips in his narration. His warmth makes the book a revealing memoir as opposed to a gossip-filled expos�.

Enjoy!"The first year I played Scrooge in Chicago's Goodman Theatre's annual production of A CHRISTMAS CAROL, my close friend and brilliant director Terry McCabe brought his children to see a matinee. At lunch afterwards, his ten-year-old daughter Hazel Flowers McCabe commented that she thought "Jacob Marley got a raw deal," (arranging Scrooge's ghostly visits, but remaining in chains himself.) We all agreed she had a point. <p>That idea rattled around inside my head for the next few years of playing Scrooge. Finally, I decided to set right this injustice, and wrote my own version of Scrooge's redemption, in which Jacob Marley is, deservedly, much more center stage. It was originally read on December 21, 1994, and received rave reviews. Adams Media published it the next year, beautifully illustrated by Larry Wojick, and it became a bestseller. </p><p>In the book, I begin with an apology, that closes with: "I approach Dickens' masterpiece with fear and trembling, but I take comfort in the knowledge that however this effort is received, A Christmas Carol will remain pristine, unbesmirched by my muddy little footprints. </p><p>But hopefully, there will be one less sad old ghost clanking about through eternity." </p><p>I hope you enjoy this. -T.

In his compelling and entertaining narrative, Thomas Cahill tells the story of how Irish monks and scrines copied the mauscripts of both pagan and Christian writers, including Homer and Aristotle, while libraries ont he continent were lost forever. Bringing the past and its characters to life, Cahill captures the sensibility of the unsung Irish who relaunched civilisation.</p><p>In this delightful and illuminating look into a crucial but little-known &#34;hinge&#34; of history, Thomas Cahill takes us to the &#34;island of saints and scholars,&#34; the Ireland of St. Patrick and the Book of Kells. Here, far from the barbarian despoliation of the continent, monks and scribes laboriously, lovingly, even playfully preserved the West&#39;s written treasury. When stability returned in Europe, these Irish scholars were instrumental in spreading learning, becoming not only the conservators of civilization, but also the shapers of the medieval mind, putting their unique stamp on Western culture.The perfect St. Patrick's Day gift, and a book in the best tradition of popular history -- the untold story of Ireland's role in maintaining Western culture while the Dark Ages settled on Europe. Every year millions of Americans celebrate St. Patrick's Day, but they may not be aware of how great an influence St. Patrick was on the subsequent history of civilization. Not only did he bring Christianity to Ireland, he instilled a sense of literacy and learning that would create the conditions that allowed Ireland to become "the isle of saints and scholars" -- and thus preserve Western culture while Europe was being overrun by barbarians. In this entertaining and compelling narrative, Thomas Cahill tells the story of how Europe evolved front the classical age of Rome to the medieval era. Without Ireland, the transition could not have taken place. Not only did Irish monks and scribes maintain the very record of Western civilization -- copying manuscripts of Greek and Latin writers, both pagan and Christian, while libraries and learning on the continent were forever lost -- they brought their uniquely Irish world-view to the task. As Cahill delightfully illustrates, so much of the liveliness we associate with medieval culture has its roots in Ireland. When the seeds of culture were replanted on the European continent, it was from Ireland that they were germinated. In the tradition of Barbara Tuchmail's <i>A Distant Mirror, How The Irish Saved Civilization</i> reconstructs an era that few know about but which is central to understanding our past and our cultural heritage. But it conveys its knowledge with a winking wit that aptly captures the sensibility of the unsung Irish who relaunched civilization.<p>"A lovely and engrossing tale . . .

After a brief introduction to two unnamed child guides and the premise of the book, a time line of the different periods and cultures, from the Stone Age to the era of piracy, is presented. From there, the real fun begins. Wood and Jolley devote a full spread to each of the 10 time periods featured. The catch: hidden in the illustrations are relics that do not belong in that specific time or region, such as a hot-air balloon in the Han Dynasty of ancient China or a gramophone among the Mughals of India. With a turn of the page, all of the objects, once concealed, are revealed with an explanation of why the item does not belong as well as what the people in that place and time used instead. The illustrations are gentle enough for younger readers to enjoy but will not alienate older readers, who will get much more out of the text. However, while the volume is informative, the lack of substantial, more detailed data is a flaw.

Boyett has published several science fiction novels and novellas and numerous short stories. He lives in Burbank, California.the world may find this book confirming their fearsor showing just how unlikely they are. Here we have a collection of Star Trek: The Next Generation parodies written in imitation of well-known authors, from literary classics (Melville, Conrad, Joyce) to modern masters (Heller, Salinger, Vonnegut) and today's bestsellers (King, Rice, Clancy, Collins). Naturally, the list includes Hemingway and Kerouac, two of the most parodied authors of the century; and Dr. Seuss's fans have not been shortchanged. While the results are inevitably uneven, there is plenty here to amuse both the Trek watcher and the literary readertwo categories that presumably have a degree of overlap. Boyett manages to walk a fine line between broad and subtle; the Melville parody (``Moby Trek'') opens, ``Call me irresponsible''; the Anthony Burgess (``A Clockwork Data'') is salted with pseudo-Russian; and the Ayn Rand (``Fandom Shrugged'') renames the starship the Free Enterprise. And where it must have been tempting to settle for obvious laughs, many of these parodies work on multiple levels: ``The Ship Also Rises'' copies the style and substance of Hemingway works ranging from ``The Snows of Kilimanjaro'' to Death in the Afternoon, meanwhile poking fun at the frustration of Patrick Stewart's stage ambitions in his role as Captain Picard, and fitting both elements into a credible Trek plot line. Boyett's brief introduction takes an appropriately mock-serious look at the meaning of Trek and at its attraction for the famous writers he parodies (some long dead before the show ever aired, but their submissions were too good to exclude just for that reason). Good fun, especially for readers who get both the literary and Trek references. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In this latest addition to the Trailblazer Books series, a little-known Christian hero from the past is vividly brought to life, a young African prince named Kaboo, later known as Samuel Morris. Prince Kaboo, born in Liberia in 1872, is about to become king of the Kru tribe when the warring Grebo people capture him for ransom. For days he is severely beaten, but when it seems his death is imminent, a blinding light flashes across the sky and a voice booms from heaven. Kaboo's enemy is so stunned that Kaboo is able to escape. Survival in the jungle would seem impossible except for the strange light that surrounds him and leads him to a mission station. Eventually, Kaboo comes to the U.S. to study the Bible at Taylor University in Upland, Indiana. Although he dies young, his dynamic story helps to preserve a foundering university and inspires countless students to travel to Africa as missionaries.

It&#x2019;s Paris, 1895. A Jewish army officer, Alfred Dreyfus, has been convicted of treason and is imprisoned on Devil&#x2019;s Island; he has been publicly humiliated, bound in chains, banished to solitary confinement. But was he really a spy for Germany--or was his fate sealed because he was a Jew in an anti-Semitic time and place? Slowly, the petit bureaucrat Georges Picquart begins to suspect that Dreyfus--portrayed here mostly through heart-wrenching real-life letters he wrote from prison to his beloved family--has been scapegoated. As Picquart amasses more and more evidence about Dreyfus, he also must come to terms with some of his own behaviors and attitudes. Still, for all its delicious detail about the mores of Belle Epoque Paris, both social and political, this novel is also one for the ages, or at least for the ages in which powerful intelligence agencies, government surveillance and cover-ups are worrisomely becoming the norm. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p>Robert Harris&#39;s work has been translated into thirty-seven languages, and he is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

Set in Depression-era Kansas and made vivid with the narrator's humorous down-home voice, it's a story of loyalty and friendship in a women's quilting circle. Young farm wife Queenie Bean tells about the brief membership of a city girl named Rita, whose boredom with country living and aspirations to be an investigative reporter lead her to unearth secrets in the close-knit group, called the Persian Pickle Club after a coveted paisley print. Queenie's desire to win Rita's friendship ("We were chickens... and Rita was a hummingbird") clashes with her loyalty to the Pickles when Rita tries to solve the murder of a member's husband, in the process unearthing complicated relationships among the women who meet each week to quilt and read aloud to each other. The result is a simple but endearing story that depicts small-town eccentricities with affection and adds dazzle with some late-breaking surprises.

In my theory, my mother had purposely put contact lenses in my eyes so that I would see the world from a different perspective, that of a Little Person. I believed that one day, my mother would remove the lenses, and when she did, I would actually be average sized. I thought it was actually some part of a bigger plan she had for me, almost as if she was doing it to teach me a lesson. Since then, I have come to find out that many persons with significant physical and/or mental challenges often rationalize their difference as the result of a greater plan for themselves or the world.<br> <br>I wasn&#x2019;t unhappy being a Little Person. Being a Little Person has always been and will always be normal to me. Even at a young age, I was used to the challenge of being a Little Person in an average-size world. For me, it wasn&#x2019;t like an accident occurred where my physical or mental capabilities changed. I was used to step stools, and always having my clothes altered, used to being observed and pointed at by strangers, and I was used to trips to the doctor in the hospital that would make other people keel over in exhaustion. But I didn&#x2019;t have time to feel that way. My parents always reminded me to count my blessings and be grateful for the things that were good in my life and that it could always be worse. I was raised not to focus on the negative, but be thankful for the positive. My parents embraced me to the degree that I thought other people might even be jealous of me.<br> <br>My birth, my big arrival, happened on March 12, 1974, at St. Anthony&#x2019;s Hospital in St. Petersburg, Florida, and was nothing short of harrowing. My mother was expecting a completely healthy baby, as she had had an uneventful pregnancy. My parents, David and Judy Arnold, were young, just twenty-one, and completely overjoyed to be having their first child. However, the difficulties started immediately in the delivery room. Not only did I come out feet first, which is very risky for a vaginal delivery, but my mother was in labor for more than twenty-four hours before that. By the time I finally emerged, she was hemorrhaging, I wasn&#x2019;t breathing, and both of us almost died.<br> <br>At least I weighed seven pounds, eleven ounces, a good, healthy size. But my respiratory distress was definitely life threatening, and I had two large hematomas under my scalp, which, with my disproportionally large head, made the situation even more dire. Although doctors knew something was terribly wrong with me right away, nobody knew exactly what it was. My parents were told I had &#x201c;water on the brain&#x201d; or hydrocephalus, which had all sorts of terrifying neurological implications. Doctors went as far as to say it would likely cause me to be mentally challenged to some degree, if I lived at all. It turns out that it wasn&#x2019;t hydrocephalus at all, but rather hydrops. Hydrops is a condition in which fluid or edema accumulates in multiple body parts of a newborn. This is a rare condition, but a known complication for babies born with dwarfism.<br> <br>I was only at St. Anthony&#x2019;s Hospital long enough for an intensive care neonatal transport vehicle to race there, sirens blaring, snatch me out of the delivery room, and rush me to All Children&#x2019;s Hospital several miles away. Here was the best neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in St. Petersburg&#x2014;in fact, one of the best NICUs in all of southwest Florida. My mother didn&#x2019;t even have a chance to lay eyes on me before they took me away. She was still so out of it from all the anesthesia and pain medications they had given her that she didn&#x2019;t even know what was happening. She had lost so much blood that she needed two transfusions and a week in the hospital to recover. I recall my mom telling me that although she didn&#x2019;t get to see me for some time, her parents, my grandmother and Papa, had seen me and kept telling her not to listen to the doctors. They were certain that I was perfectly perfect and was going to be fine.<br> <br>I was seven days old when she finally got to come to the NICU to meet me. Before she got there, she had heard so many terrifying terms to describe my condition, she had no idea what to expect. No matter how many issues the doctors enumerated and described, she didn&#x2019;t fear bonding with me. She totally loved me and only loved me that much more when she finally saw me.<br> <br>My mom had a strong faith that God would take care of her small family, as He had never presented her with an impossible situation or guided her wrong before. In fact, to this day, she credits her faith with getting her through my birth, which undercut the happiest day of her life with extraordinary, terrifying unknowns. Her motherly instincts kicked in with a vengeance, and she instantly became my protector, advocate, and supporter with everything she had.<br> <br>My mother was not shy about expressing that at first glance she and my father were not the ideal parents for me. They were young, practically broke, and very na�ve. But, they got through it all with strength and perseverance.<br> <br>I had two traumatic weeks in the NICU. Even after my respiratory distress became less life-threatening, I still had many problems. The doctors were throwing out all kinds of diagnoses, but, through no fault of their own, they didn&#x2019;t hit on skeletal dysplasia. It was not a well-known diagnosis and often it can be difficult to see the physical features of skeletal dysplasia soon after birth. For the moment, the doctors and my parents were just happy I no longer needed assistance breathing. The neonatologists were still concerned about the hydrops, though they hoped it would resolve on its own.<br> <br>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br> <br>MY PARENTS HAD been married for about a year when I was born. They had met at a Winn-Dixie supermarket in St. Petersburg, where my mother was a part-time cashier and my father was a manager. My father had a crush on my mother from the moment he saw her, but the feeling wasn&#x2019;t, at least at first, mutual. When he learned she loved horses enough to save all her paychecks to buy one, he capitalized on their common interest. He loved horses, too, having been raised around them. When he heard about my mother&#x2019;s purchase, he knew the perfect gift&#x2014;a bridle. She was so impressed that he had tuned in to her interest that the romance budded immediately.<br> <br>When my mother became pregnant, my parents moved into a little apartment in my maternal grandparents&#x2019; house in St. Petersburg. My grandfather, aka Papa, had converted the two-car garage of the house into a cozy apartment for them. My grandparents wanted my mother nearby, and with the baby coming, there was the added benefit of a houseful of people who could help them out&#x2014;besides my grandmother, my mother&#x2019;s two younger sisters, my aunts Barbara and Chrissy, still lived at home. Barbara was sixteen, five years younger than Mom, and Chrissy was eleven. I grew up very close to both my aunts. My uncle Wayne, who was just finishing high school at the time, also lived there.<br> <br>My mother set up a beautiful nursery for me in the corner of the apartment, with the nicest crib she could buy and a wardrobe full of pink onesies and bonnets. She was half terrified, then thrilled when I was finally released from the NICU. She did her absolute best not to be too consumed with the state of my future health.<br> <br>My trips to the pediatrician were far more frequent than those of newborns without issues. As the months went by and my pediatrician kept tracking my height, weight, and head circumference, I kept slipping further and further off the chart for height and weight, even as I climbed the chart in head circumference. Very concerned with my body mass, the pediatricians diagnosed me as &#x201c;failing to thrive.&#x201d; They thought maybe it was a nutrition issue, plain and simple&#x2014;that my mom wasn&#x2019;t feeding me enough, which is not unusual for a first-time mother. That possibility terrified my mom, who thought that if I had malnutrition, child services might come to intervene and take me away. She tried so hard to make me eat more, she was beside herself! I mean, how much baby food and formula can a baby tolerate? Because no one had diagnosed me with a form of dwarfism, they didn&#x2019;t realize that nutrition and food quantity was never an issue. My condition was rare, and the pediatricians were only going through a process of elimination, but they had my mother frantic.<br> <br>Then came the next stressor. Right before my first birthday, we moved to a small rental apartment in Orlando, a hundred miles from St. Petersburg, after my father accepted a job from my mother&#x2019;s uncle. He was going to be managing a string of gas stations in the boomtown. My aunt Barbara, with her parents&#x2019; permission, moved with us and stayed a year.<br> <br>The Walt Disney World Resort had just opened, although it was so small and new that there were only three operating hotels on its whole forty square miles. However, because of the resort, the city was already the hottest, hippest town in Florida. My mother got a part-time job waitressing at the Fort Wilderness area inside the park. Fort Wilderness was a vacation spot within Disney World with rustic cabins and campsites featuring a Wild West theme. My mom had to dress the part of a cowgirl, but she didn&#x2019;t mind. She made many friends working there that she might not have met otherwise.<br> <br>The first thing my parents did after the move was find a new pediatrician. Without knowing anyone with kids to give them references, they took a chance with Pediatrics Associates of Orlando, a group practice not too far from our neighborhood. By the purest stroke of luck, the doctor in the group who saw me first was Dr. Colin Condron, who turned out to be the link to determining my diagnosis. He had done his pediatric training at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, which was the finest pediatric orthopedic unit in the country, with specialized clinics for genetic-based issues, including dwarfism. He told my mother he wanted her to take me to the Moore Clinic, a genetics clinic, as he thought they could confirm my diagnosis. He also arranged to have all our travel expenses paid for by the hospital by enrolling me as a participant in a study currently underway. Back then it wasn&#x2019;t unusual for academic hospitals to admit a patient with a rare or unusual diagnosis for evaluation.<br> <br>I spent two weeks at the Moore Clinic, undergoing every medical workup possible. What good fortune to have on my case Dr. Victor A. McKusick, a professor of medicine and medical genetics at Johns Hopkins Hospital with a reputation around the world for his expertise in unusual hereditary diseases! He is often referred to as the father of clinical genetics and was the original author of Mendelian Inheritance in Man, the most extensive database of all inheritable diseases. He was the first person to diagnose me with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia (SED), type Strudwick, the specific type of dwarfism I had been born with. I believe he did this with a physical examination and a few X-rays.<br> <br>SED is a type of skeletal dysplasia that involves significant skeletal abnormalities affecting the spine, long bones, and joints. What the diagnosis meant for me was a childhood filled with orthopedic surgeries just to maintain mobility. SED is characterized by anomalies of the growth plates, joints, and spine, resulting in debilitating deformities such a scoliosis, knock knee, early osteoarthritis and joint degradation in your twenties, and other major joint problems. SED is rare, occurring in only about one in one hundred thousand births. Although it can be passed down from an abnormal gene from one parent, the majority of cases result from spontaneous mutations. Unfortunately, it turned out my case was quite severe, and Dr. McKusick said I&#x2019;d need many surgeries.<br> <br>The fact that Dr. Condron had had such great training and expertise to identify that I likely had a skeletal dysplasia and sent me to the specialists at Johns Hopkins Hospital early was a miracle. Of course, once Dr. Condron got me to the Moore Clinic, my parents also got to meet someone who would forever change our lives, Steven E. Kopits, MD. Dr. Kopits would become my orthopedic surgeon and my lifesaver. At the time we met him, Dr. Kopits was the chief resident of pediatric orthopedics at Johns Hopkins Hospital, a position he cherished. He was from a long line of orthopedic physicians, as both his father and grandfather were orthopedic surgeons in Hungary, his native country. After World War II, the Kopits family left Hungary and settled in Argentina, where my Dr. Kopits got his medical degree at the Universidad de Buenos Aires. He then came to the United States, doing his internship at Union Memorial Hospital in Baltimore and his residency at Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was then and there that his interest in patients with skeletal dysplasias was born. Not only was he a talented and dedicated physician and surgeon, but he also invented procedures no one had ever tried before that often led to lifesaving treatments for children with skeletal dysplasias. He was somehow able to see a patient&#x2019;s deformity and tailor a surgical procedure to make what was not functional before work. There were times when Dr. Kopits would come out of the operating room and tell a patient&#x2019;s parents that he used a technique he had never used before during the operation, but ta-da, it worked, and he expected outstanding results!<br> <br>Dr. Kopits hadn&#x2019;t always been a specialist in dwarfism. However, because Johns Hopkins had such a large patient population with genetic illnesses, he found himself working with many genetic-based orthopedic problems, and his passion soon became the skeletal deformities of dwarfism. He had told me that it was evident to him that this was a unique patient population with unique issues, which no one had yet taken an interest in caring for.<br> <br>Dr. Kopits was certifiably a hero, a miracle maker, to each and every Little Person who had the pleasure of being his patient. In fact, to those whom I know who were blessed enough to see him, he was infinitely more than a physician. We all considered him a beloved friend and a true member of our families.<br> <br>According to my mother, that first trip to Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Moore Clinic was much more traumatic for her than for me. She had absolutely no idea what to expect, and two weeks seemed like forever, so she was in a whirlwind of fear. On the one hand, she was relieved to have gotten a diagnosis for me, but she was equally overwhelmed by that diagnosis. One of the genetic specialists gave her an informational pamphlet about the size of a comic book that was filled with black-and-white photos of different people with my condition. The picture pages showed the severe orthopedic complications and deformities of children and adults. It was enough to scare her to death.<br> <br>Dr. Kopits, a miracle worker to parents as well as patients, assured my mother that I would be well taken care of and that my prognosis was fairly good, but the list of surgeries he thought I would need throughout my life was something no parent wanted to hear. It was clear it wasn&#x2019;t going to be easy.<br> <br>My first surgery was about a year later, when I was two. It was probably the biggest surgery I&#x2019;d ever have, a cervical spine fusion on account of the instability in my spine. I had to have my top two vertebrae, C1 and C2, fused together. These two are the highest on the spine, right behind the skull, and when they are as unstable as mine were, any significant fall or jolt to one&#x2019;...</p><h2>Gethsemane</h2><p>Used.

It draws on unprecedented access to Bellow&#x2019;s papers, including much previously restricted material, as well as interviews with more than 150 of the novelist&#x2019;s relatives, close friends, colleagues, and lovers, a number of whom have never spoken to researchers before. Through detailed exploration of Bellow&#x2019;s writings, and the private history that informed them, Leader chronicles a singular life in letters, offering original and nuanced accounts not only of the novelist&#x2019;s development and rise to eminence, but of his many identities&#x2014;as writer, polemicist, husband, father, Chicagoan, Jew, American.<br><br> The biography will be published in two volumes. The first volume, <i>To Fame and Fortune: 1915&#x2013;1964</i>, traces Bellow&#x2019;s Russian roots; his birth and early childhood in Quebec; his years in Chicago; his travels in Mexico, Europe, and Israel; the first three of his five marriages; and the novels from <i>Dangling Man</i> and <i>The Adventures of Augie March</i> to the best-selling <i>Herzog. </i>New light is shed on Bellow&#x2019;s fellow writers, including Ralph Ellison, John Berryman, Lionel Trilling, and Philip Roth, and on his turbulent and influential life away from the desk, which was as full of incident as his fiction. Bellow emerges as a compelling character, and Leader&#x2019;s powerful accounts of his writings, published and unpublished, forward the case for his being, as the critic James Wood puts it, &#x201c;the greatest of American prose stylists in the twentieth century.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>ZACHARY LEADER</b> is professor of English literature at the University of Roehampton in London.

By the spring of 1937 they were engaged. Anita had been at the University of Chicago only a year, having transferred from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, as a junior (shortly after the death of her father, which suggests the move may have been motivated by family or financial considerations). The &#x201c;grimy&#x201d; sociology books she carried at their first meeting were for a summer course at the university. She was six months older than Bellow, born on December 12, 1914, and like him lived on the North Side, in Ravenswood, a modest suburb of small courtyard apartment buildings. Bellow told his son Greg that he&#x2019;d had his eye on Anita for some time, before gathering the courage to speak to her. Her cousin and childhood playmate, Beebee Schenk (later de Regniers), was a friend of Bellow&#x2019;s, and may have told him to look out for her.1 On their first date, they went swimming in Lake Michigan off the Point, a Hyde Park landmark. In Herzog, Bellow fictionalizes the moment they met. Moses sees Daisy, who will become his first wife, under the El at 51st Street. Pretty and fresh in appearance, with large &#x201c;slant green&#x201d; eyes, she wears a simple seersucker dress and small white shoes. Her &#x201c;golden but lustreless&#x201d; hair is held in place by a barrette and her legs are bare. Moses sees the square-cut neck of her dress as expressive of character: &#x201c;stability, symmetry, order, containment were Daisy&#x2019;s strength.&#x201d; Her &#x201c;laundered purity&#x201d; also strikes him, as does her coolness and regular features, those of &#x201c;a conventional Jewish woman.&#x201d; As Moses stands behind her on the El platform, a &#x201c;fragrance of summer apples&#x201d; rises from her bare neck and shoulders (pp. 542&#x2013;43).2<br> &nbsp;<br> This fragrance is also expressive, for Daisy is a country girl of sorts, raised near Zanesville, Ohio. Anita came from a similar background, in Lafayette, Indiana, not exactly the country, but not Chicago either. Her parents, like Bellow&#x2019;s, were Russian immigrants. Her father, Morris, arrived from the Crimea after the pogroms of 1905, settling in Lafayette for the same reason the Bellows settled first in Lachine then in Chicago: because he had relatives there. He worked as a milkman, then opened an ice cream parlor. What Greg Bellow remembers hearing of his maternal grandfather is that he was &#x201c;quiet, kind and gentle.&#x201d; It was Sonia, Morris&#x2019;s wife, a forceful, opinionated, modern woman, a suffragette in Russia, who ruled the roost, encouraging her daughters to be independent and insisting that they go to college.3<br> &nbsp;<br> Like Bellow, Anita was the only member of her family to be born in the New World. A late arrival, she was much doted on. She had two brothers, Jack (also known as J.J.) and Max, seventeen and ten years older, and two sisters, Catherine and Ida, sixteen and fourteen years older. The sisters became librarians, earned higher degrees in library science, traveled in Europe, were lovers of high culture, and never married. When they retired, they moved to New York, living together in an apartment close to Lincoln Center, to be near the ballet. Of the brothers, Jack, the eldest, had an affair in college with a non-Jewish girl. When she got pregnant, he married her. According to Greg, Anita&#x2019;s mother was so scandalized by these events, &#x201c;that, basically, she forced Jack to divorce . . . and move back in.&#x201d; Jack&#x2019;s son, Jack Jr., was raised out of state by his mother and on rare visits to Lafayette &#x201c;was kept on the back porch, incommunicado.&#x201d; When the Goshkins moved to Chicago and the son visited, his father &#x201c;checked into a hotel.&#x201d; Anita&#x2019;s other brother, Max, a machinist, also lived at home, well into his forties.<br> &nbsp;<br> Anita was political at college. When Greg was a student at Chicago, &#x201c;with great pride&#x201d; she pointed out to him the spot in the lobby of the Social Sciences building where she had once sold a hundred copies of Soapbox in an hour. She attended political meetings and regularly spoke at them. She went to Gary, Indiana, to organize steelworkers, was arrested, and spent a night in jail, along with Bellow&#x2019;s friend Oscar Tarcov. Her interest in politics was practical; she had little patience for theoretical or doctrinal dispute. The two-year MA program she entered in March 1937 in Chicago&#x2019;s School of Social Service Administration involved fieldwork at the Michael Reese Hospital, one of the oldest and largest teaching hospitals in Chicago. There Anita met Bruno Bettelheim, who later remarked to Greg on his mother&#x2019;s beauty. Anita finished the first year of the course but not the second, which required that she write a dissertation. She could not write, or thought she could not write, a conclusion she&#x2019;d been led to as an undergraduate. &#x201c;My father told me he wrote most of her term papers,&#x201d; Greg recalls. After abandoning her MA in 1939 she got a job at the Chicago Relief Administration giving out welfare checks. By this date she and Bellow had been married over a year.</p><h2>Amy Lowell: Selected Poems: (American Poets Project #12)</h2><p>A cigar-smoking proponent of free-verse modernism in open rebellion against her distinguished Boston lineage, Amy Lowell cut an indelible public figure. But in the words of editor Honor Moore, &#x201c;what strikes the modern reader is not the sophistication of Lowell&#x2019;s feminist or anti-war stances, but the bald audacity of her eroticism.&#x201d;<br><br>Lowell was at the center of a group of pioneering modernists who, in an era convulsed by change, rejected musty Victorian standards and wrote poems of bracing immediacy. This new selection captures her full formal range: the &#x201c;cadenced verse&#x201d; of her Imagist masterpieces, her experiments in &#x201c;polyphonic prose,&#x201d; her narrative poetry, and her adaptations from the classical Chinese. It gives a fresh sense of the passion and energy of her work.<br><br><b>About the American Poets Project</b><br>Elegantly designed in compact editions, printed on acid-free paper, and textually authoritative, the American Poets Project makes available the full range of the American poetic accomplishment, selected and introduced by today&#x2019;s most discerning poets and critics.</p><p><b>Honor Moore</b>&nbsp;is the author of the poetry collections&nbsp;<i>Darling</i>,&nbsp;<i>Red Shoes</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Memoi</i>, and she edited&nbsp;<i>Poems from the Women&#x2019;s Movement</i>&nbsp;for the American Poets Project.

It emphasizes the idea that the soul communicates with the human personality through the intuition. Much importance is placed on how to correctly register these intuitions within the mind. The book affirms the importance of supporting humanity&#x2019;s upliftment, and provides the ancient principles that make soulful service truly possible.</p><p>For more than twenty years, William Meader has been a student and teacher of the Esoteric Spiritual Tradition. He is also an experienced teacher of both Eastern and Western meditation practices. In addition to his spiritual interests, he has an advanced degree in the behavioral sciences and has several years of experience as a psychology instructor in California. His work is international in scope. Currently he is teaching the Esoteric Philosophy in the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and several countries in Europe.Every human being is destined to become a spiritual magician. From the esoteric view of life, this is considered an indisputable fact. It is not a destiny as normally conceived, for we are referring to the fate of the soul, and not that of the ego&#x2014;the personality. The soul evolves over vast periods of time, and its ultimate goal is to creatively express itself through a cooperative personality. By so doing, it influences the outer world through its power to magically uplift. This is the core purpose behind human evolution, and is the clue to the hidden yearnings of the soul. For this reason, each and every human being will eventually become a spiritual magician. The evolution of consciousness demands it be so. In this treatise, our attention will be directed to the soul as it evolves itself into the serving magician on behalf of humanity&#x2019;s upliftment. This is the destiny of every human soul, in this incarnation or another. It is to shine forth into form, and by so doing, contribute to the betterment of the larger whole.</p><h2>Written That You May Believe</h2><p>A prominent Scripture scholar opens the riches of the gospel of John, revealing the profound spiritual vision offered to every reader.

One of her family's employees is missing, and he disappeared on the very same day she landed in the hospital. <br>Desperate to figure out what happened, she befriends Euan McEwen, the Scottish Traveller boy who found her when she was injured, and his standoffish sister, Ellen. As Julie grows closer to this family, she witnesses firsthand some of the prejudices they've grown used to-a stark contrast to her own upbringing-and finds herself exploring thrilling new experiences that have nothing to do with a missing-person investigation. <br>Her memory of that day returns to her in pieces, and when a body is discovered, her new friends are caught in the crosshairs of long-held biases about Travellers.

An instructive, anecdotal chapter walks home bakers through pastry making how to&#39;s. Answers to questions home bakers want to know. The only resource a home baker needs.</p><p>At 640 pages and nearly two inches thick, <i>Pie</i>, the big book with the shortest possible title, is difficult to read in bed. It's hard to hold up. It weighs on the stomach. But bed is where you will want to take it, night after night, following author Richard Haedrich's lead through fruit pies, berry pies, nut pies, custard pies, turnovers, ice cream pies, and more. Headrich has the most reassuring voice in food literature, and his lifelong passion--the making and baking of all manner of pies--soon begins to fit the reader like new skin. <p> The first 60 pages are given over to general directions (for example, Haedrich is a firm believer in reading a recipe through to completion before lifting a finger; he rolls his dough on wax paper) and the making and shaping of crust. You will find everything you need to know about creating terrific pie crusts including a friendly pat on the back and the sage advice that great crust comes with experience. This is all but permission to bake several pies a week for the rest of your life. The 300 some recipes in <i>Pie</i> will help you on your way. There are 21 crust recipes alone, everything from that perfect flaky crust to Choco-Nut Press-In Pie Crust.</p><p> Ever hear of the Balaton, what sounds like the perfect pie cherry? Haedrich doesn't just give you a cherry pie recipe (there are actually nine), he tells you all about cherries (there's a box titled "Crash Course in Cherries"). And talking about cherries leads to talking about regions of the country, the people in the landscape, the fruit on the trees. You will travel endless miles of back roads with <i>Pie</i>. Haedrich feeds you information in easy bursts, like conversational asides, as recipe leads, as sidebars, as boxes, as how-to notes the author calls "Recipe for Success." In just the pages on cherry pie you'll find out about product sources, sanding sugar, pitting cherries inside plastic bags, lattice pie crusts, baking with kids, knotting cherry stems with your tongue, IQF (individually quick frozen fruit), and much more. And cherry pie isn't a chapter all its own, but a small part of the chapter called Summer Fruit Pies. All told there are 13 chapters in <i>Pie</i>.</p><p> Books like <i>Pie</i> don't happen overnight, or even over a year of nights. Haedrich didn't apply his considerable food writing skill to a subject he simply pulled off the shelf. While the tone may be easy going, there's nothing casual here about either the task or the accomplishment. <i>Pie</i> represents a considerable chunk of one man's life wedged between the covers of a book. The tens of thousands of bits and pieces of valuable information, quotes, lines of poetry, not to mention the recipes and careful instruction comes from years and years of both accumulation and winnowing down to the very best. </p><p> And all along, page after page, there's that implacably friendly, reassuring voice, leading, encouraging, enlightening. How often do you crack open a cookbook and wind up with a new best friend? Such is the nature of a great book. Such is the magic of <i>Pie</i> and Ken Haedrich. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>A cookbook for everyone who wants to master the art of baking pies. Everything is explained in detail and is easy to understand. Building your confidence is Ken Haedrichs key to success. Chuck Williams, founder of Williams-Sonoma &nbsp; Ken Haedrichs passion for pies is unmistakable. The comprehensive volume covers the craft of pie baking from A to Z. From the simple to the sublime, <i>Pie</i> is a must have on your bookshelf. Carole Walter, author of <i>Great Cakes, Pies, Cookies, Muffins &amp; More</i> &nbsp; Ken Haedrich has had a special affinity for pies since he was a little boy. This is both an amazing collection of wanderings through his pie ways and a launching pad for your own ideas. Its a book Ill keep nearby all year to explore every pie in every season.

He focuses on the methodological function of anecdotal narrative in human science research, and offers methods for structuring the research text in relation to the particular kinds of questions being studied.

Abandoned by his manager, Crews's glass-jawed hero has to support himself by exhibiting his trick at parties. After 73 self-inflicted KO's, the routine gets a little wearing. Meanwhile, Eugene is taken up by Charity, a rich, all-but-the-dissertation Ph.D. candidate bent on constructing a thesis that relates every fact in the world to every other fact. She thinks Eugene and his prizefighting friends are a gold mine of information for this dubious project. A brilliant specialist in black humor, Crews delivers the goods once again. His deadpan prose style is uncannily effective in meshing the surreal and everyday life. While the characters are mainly freaks, they come across so directly, often with an affecting sweetness, that they acquire extraordinary vibrancy. Crews is a modernist all right, but he isn't a facile one. The moral here and elsewhere in his work is old-fashioned: to thine own self be true. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Long, Obstinate, and Bloody: The Battle of Guilford Courthouse</h2><p>On 15 March 1781, the armies of Nathanael Greene and Lord Charles Cornwallis fought one of the bloodiest and most intense engagements of the American Revolution at the Guilford Courthouse in piedmont North Carolina.

This 1953 classic in a new edition captures the very essence of the people and place. Having already learned to appreciate Muslim life when he was in Pakistan, Mayne bought a house in the labyrinthine back streets of Marrakesh. He wanted to settle there, not as a privileged visitor in a hotel or grand villa, but as one of the inhabitants. He learned their language, made friends, took part in their festivals, and wrote their letters. This is not a travel book in the accepted sense of the word-it is a record of personal experience in a region of foreign life well beyond the tourist&#39;s eye. Mayne contrives in a deceptively simple prose to disseminate in the air of an English November the spicy odors of North Africa; he has turned, for an hour, smog to shimmering sunlight, woven a texture of extraordinary charm.</p><p>Peter Mayne was born in England in 1908. At the age of twenty he went out to India, where his father was a serior member of the Department of Education. For a while he worked as a mercantile assistant in a firm of merchant-shippers, but he was never a successful businessman. At the time of Partition, the Pakistan Government invited him to serve as Deputy Secretary to the Ministry of Refugees and Rehabilitation. When the tension died down, he resigned from government service and settled in Morocco to write his first book.

Goldman portrays Presley as the archetypal superstar, a catalyst of American popular culture - glorified, condemned, and mythicized during his reign as King of the Age of Rock. After three years of research and over 600 interviews, the truth about the pop culture phenomenon of the century is told here for the first time in a book that combines astonishing disclosures with brilliant cultural commentary. Albert Goldman dramatizes with a novelist&#39;s skill the rise and fall of Elvis Presley. He illuminates the man and the myth against a backdrop of Memphis and Vegas, down-home religion and pink Cadillacs, white gospel and rhythm and blues and the music that rocked. Here is the life and times - the schemes and scams, the money and power plays, the decadence and dissolution and the panoply of life as showbiz. Albert Goldman&#39;s work has made obsolete the trendy books spawned by Presley&#39;s death. His is a monumental achievement, the most electric and explosive work ever published on the culture shock called Elvis.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Hegel&#39;s Science of Logic</h2><p>Reissue from the classic Muirhead Library of Philosophy series (originally published between 1890s - 1970s).</p><p>Translator A.

Born after her parents tried three unsuccessful times to produce a male heir--two older sisters and a brother who died within hours of birth preceded Diana Spencer's arrival--she felt unwanted from the start. Her mother's abandonment of the family six years later compounded Diana's feelings of self-worthlessness. At a tender age, the girl who would grow up to be the beloved Princess of Wales had already irrevocably lost her sense of self. The book, which relies heavily on the accounts of anonymous intimates of the late princess, describes her as a deeply conflicted character. A friend is quoted as saying, "Her dark side was that of a wounded trapped animal ... and her bright side was that of a luminous being." The strikingly tall, blond princess who cradled young cancer victims and graciously accepted flowers from admirers, who frolicked on camera with her young sons and flashed her sparkling smile as she exited limousines, was often sulky, depressed, and vengeful in private. "Why?" one might wonder--if volumes hadn't already been written about the awful truth of her life.<p> Author Sally Bedell Smith revisits the well-trod ground of Charles's continuing love affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, Diana's intimidation by her royal in-laws, and her push-me, pull-me relationship with the voracious paparazzi. In addition, she details Diana's numerous love affairs and her acts of self-mutilation and bizarre behavior, such as the incident in which she tap-danced alone in her room until she wore down the wood parquet. Prince Charles comes off as a sympathetic if somewhat wimpy character, while, as the book progresses, Diana grows into a woman navigating the fine line between neurosis and full-blown psychosis. At the time of her marriage, the princess is quoted as saying she was "so in love with my husband that I couldn't take my eyes off him. I just absolutely thought I was the luckiest girl in the world." Years later, she would recall this same day thus: "The day I walked down the aisle at St. Paul's Cathedral, I felt that my personality was taken away from me, and I was taken over by the royal machine." Her bulimia (even while pregnant with Prince William), paranoia, lying, and flightiness are all confirmed in Smith's tome but they are commingled with testimonials to the late princess's generosity, intuition, genuine warmth, and ability to put anyone at ease. Diana was fine--to wit sane--as long as she was in a safe environment. The bosom of the royal family was not one of those havens. But she wasn't a passive victim--her famous comment about her marriage being overcrowded, involving three people, presumably herself, the prince, and Parker Bowles--wasn't quite true, as she was also having an affair at the time, bringing the number up to four.</p><p> All of these excruciating details--including Smith's analysis of how long the Dodi and Diana match would have lasted, had they not been killed that night in Paris--seem to be carefully researched and attributed when the source allows it, and build to the grand crescendo of the book, in which Smith proffers her diagnosis of the princess's mental health. The punchline here is that the tabloid assertions that hounded Diana throughout her lifetime, asserting that she was "loony," "potty," a "basket case," or "barking mad," may have held more than a kernel of truth. But if the princess was as expert a manipulator as the book suggests, no one, it seems, could ever hope to know the whole truth. <i>--Jordana Moskowitz</i></p>rch of Herself is the first authoritative biography of one of the most fabled women of the century.

Carter</strong><br><br><strong>Question:</strong> <em>Jericho's Fall</em> is a departure from your previous novels. What made you decide to turn your attention to a spy thriller?<br> <strong>Stephen L. Carter:</strong> I was ready for a change of pace.&nbsp; My other novels have been large&#x2014;as the reviewers like to say, multi-layered.&nbsp; I wanted to try a short, straightforward page turner, a book to be read for the sheer pleasure of the story.&nbsp; Thrillers are fun to read, and, as I discovered, they are also lots of fun to write.&nbsp; If readers like <em>Jericho's Fall</em>, I expect I will write more of them. <p><strong>Question:</strong> In your "Author's Note" you write that "the problem of mental illness among intelligence professionals is often said to be endemic." This link between intelligence work and madness is certainly born out in your character Jericho Ainsley.&nbsp; Why do you think this link exists and is this what drew you to Jericho's story?<br> <strong>Stephen L. Carter:</strong> In researching my previous novel, <em>Palace Council</em>, I became fascinated by the problem of mental illness in the intelligence community, an issue much-commented on in the 1960s and 1970s, mainly because of James Jesus Angleton, whose paranoia when he ran counter-intelligence at the CIA nearly tore the place apart. I thought that structuring a story around an ex-spy who was losing his mind might provide a nice hook, and the rest just followed. <br></p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Jericho is former Director of the CIA, former Secretary of Defense, former White House National Security Advisor ("former everything" as you refer to him). You seem equally interested in how his career affected not only him but his family and in particular his ex-lover Rebecca DeForde ("Beck"). Why did you decide to make Beck the center of the story?<br> <strong>Stephen L. Carter:</strong><strong> </strong>My first novel, <em>The Emperor of Ocean Park</em>, dealt in part with what happens to the family of a man who is embittered after losing a tough confirmation battle for the Supreme Court.&nbsp; Here, I thought about the men in public life who have been brought down (or nearly brought down) by their relationships with women. We always find out what happened to the men, but rarely what happened to the women.&nbsp; In Beck DeForde, I wrote a character who was once "the other woman" to a famous man, and has had to rebuild her life after their tempestuous relationship ended.&nbsp; The idea of drawing her into the conspiratorial web surrounding her ex-lover was irresistible.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> Have you always been fascinated with the idea of spies and secrets? <br> <strong>Stephen L. Carter:</strong> It is not spying itself that interests me, it is the people who do it. I have done some reading about the toll that intelligence work takes on families, and here I have tried to imagine it fictionally.</p> <p>As to secrets, I teach a course at Yale Law School on secrets and the law. We build powerful walls to keep secrets, and most of them are probably not worth keeping. Those that are, sooner or later tend to leak through the wall. No doubt there are some secrets that should be kept, but classification and national security tempt those in power to keep in the darkness acts and words that should be dragged into the light. One rule of thumb I wish all officials would follow is this: Don't do anything you're not willing to defend in your memoirs.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> What sort of research did this novel require?&nbsp; Did you have to investigate the history of the CIA? What it's like to work in the intelligence community? Interrogation techniques? Did your research into the intelligence community unearth any surprises?<br><strong>Stephen L. Carter:</strong> I did a lot of research about the CIA, its history, its structure, its personalities, as well as about various mental illnesses.&nbsp; One thing that struck me was how much mental illness there has been, historically, near the top of the Agency. I mentioned Angleton. Frank Wisner, the father of the clandestine services, had a nervous breakdown while on the job. There are other, smaller stories, as well.<br></p> <strong>Question:</strong><strong> </strong>After his retirement, Jericho went to work for a big financial firm where he may have been using his former ties and connections to perpetrate a massive financial fraud. While you are clear to point out that this is fiction it does seem that many government big wigs transition to the financial sector. Should we be troubled about this tendency? Have there been financial scandals involving former CIA agents?<strong><br></strong><strong>Stephen L. Carter:</strong><strong> </strong>The CIA has had its share of financial scandals, but the larger problem, I think, is the way that people parlay government service into multi-million dollar stints lobbying and litigating against the very agencies they used to run. Such conduct is not, nor should it be, illegal;&nbsp; but it does not look good either.<strong><br></strong><strong><br>Question:</strong><strong> </strong>Can people who dedicate their lives to keeping secrets and trading in conspiracies, ever really retire from that kind of work?<strong><br></strong><strong>Stephen L. Carter:</strong><strong> </strong>Of course one can retire, but this line of work has to have a lasting effect. If you live your life not talking about your work, it can be difficult to settle into a life where you can talk about everything. And people who have been on the inside often suffer when forced to sit on the outside instead.<strong><br><br></strong><strong>Question:</strong><strong> </strong><em>Jericho's Fall</em> is set mainly in a small town in the Colorado Rockies. How and why did you choose this particular setting for the novel? <strong><br></strong><strong>Stephen L. Carter:</strong><strong> </strong>I have spent a lot of time in the Colorado Rockies over the past thirty years, and it is a region of the country I dearly love. There are, moreover, many places in the mountains where cell phone service is iffy or non-existence. Being cut off from the outside world is of course red meat to the thriller writer...<br><br><strong>Question:</strong> Jericho's house, Stone Heights, is itself a character in this novel, one with its own secrets and surprises. It harks back to such stories as <em>Wuthering Heights</em> or <em>Rebecca</em> or an Agatha Christie mystery where the physical setting is as much a character as the people.&nbsp; Did you have any of those stories in mind as you wrote this?<br><strong>Stephen L. Carter:</strong> Oh, yes.&nbsp; I remember reading Thomas Hardy as a teenager, and being fascinated by the way that the house or the pond or the moor was always brooding over the action.&nbsp; Here, I had in effect two "physical" characters, the house itself, and the mountains that surround both Stone Heights and the town of Bethel. By the way, the town of Bethel is fictitious, but of course bears a biblical relation to Jericho.<br><strong><br>Question:</strong> In your previous books characters from earlier novels have gone on to appear in future novels.&nbsp; Will we see more of any of the characters from this novel?<br><strong>Stephen L. Carter:</strong> If I keep writing short thrillers like this one, we will certainly see some of these characters again.&nbsp; By the way, one of the minor characters in <em>Jericho's Fall</em>, a law professor named Tish Kirschbaum, was also a minor character in <em>The Emperor of Ocean Park</em>. So I have kept the connections going.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><br></strong> <p></p> <strong></strong> <p>(Photo � Elena Seibert)</p>The Mountain <br><br>(i) <br><br>Darkness bore down on her as the car shuddered up the mountain. Distant lights danced at the edge of her vision, then vanished. Beck wondered how bad it would be. In her mind, she saw only the Jericho she had loved fifteen yeas ago and, in some ways, still did: the dashing scion of an old New England family that had provided government officials since the Revolution. One of his ancestors had a traffic circle named for him in Washington. A cousin served in the Senate. The family&#x2019;s history was overwhelming; the Jericho for whom Beck had fallen had certainly overwhelmed her. He had been brilliant, and powerful, and confident, and fun, ever ready with eternal wisdom, or clever barbs. She did not like to think of that mighty man ravaged by disease. She had no illusions. She remembered what cancer had done to her own father.<br><br>Whatever was waiting, she had to go.<br><br>On Saturday afternoon, having cleared her decks with Pfister, Beck took the shuttle from Boston to Washington. She lived in Virginia, a stone&#x2019;s throw from Reagan National Airport. Her daughter was at a church retreat, church being a thing that Beck did because she had been raised that way, and her mother would be offended if Rebecca dared differ. Beck decided to let Nina stay the night with the other kids. The two of them could ride together to the airport on Sunday, then enplane for their different destinations. Rebecca&#x2019;s mother, Jacqueline, had been after her for weeks to send Nina for a visit, and maybe this was the time. The child was only in second grade; missing a few days of instruction would do her no harm. Beck hesitated, then made the inevitable call to Florida, to ask if her mother could look after Nina. The conversation soon turned into a battle.<br><br><i>I don&#x2019;t know how you could even think about taking a six-year-old to visit a man like that.</i><br><br><i>I&#x2019;m not taking her, Mom. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m calling you.</i><br><br><i>You said you decided not to take her. That means you thought about it. I don&#x2019;t understand how your mind works sometimes.</i><br><br>She tried, and failed, to remember a time when she and her mother had not been at odds. Because, in the eyes of her eternally disappointed mother, Beck would never be more than ten years old. Certainly their animosity predated Jericho; and perhaps it had played some sort of role (as every one of the therapists Rebecca had consulted over the years seemed to think) in her falling in love, as a college sophomore, with a married man thirty-two years her senior who tossed away his remarkable career in order to possess her.<br><br><i>I appreciate your help, Mom.</i><br><br><i>Oh, so you appreciate me now. Does that mean you&#x2019;ll call more often?</i><br><br>But Beck rarely called anybody. She was not the calling sort. She lived in a cookie-cutter townhouse in Alexandria, along with her daughter and the cat, and when she was not homemaking or child-rearing she was working. Her mother had married young, and was supported by her husband until the day he died. Beck&#x2019;s marriage had lasted less than two years. The thing with Jericho had ruined Rebecca for men, her mother insisted; and maybe it was true. Her mother was full of certitudes about the errors of others, and for the next few days would fill Nina&#x2019;s mind with her fevered dogmas. Hating herself, Beck had put her daughter on the plane to Florida anyway; and Nina, cradling the cat carrier, had marched regally into the jetway, never turning her head for a final wave, because she was a lot more like her grandmother than like her mother.<br><br>Or maybe not. Rebecca herself had been a feisty child, curious and willful and prepared at any moment to be disobedient. She had always pretended that she was fine without her mother, perhaps because her mother spent so much time insisting on the opposite. Her rebelliousness had led her into trouble all her life, including at her pricey private high school, where a protest against the dress code had led to a suspension; and at Princeton, where a star wide receiver tried to have his way with the reluctant freshman and wound up with a broken nose for his troubles, missing half the season. A year later, she had wound up in Jericho&#x2019;s bed. Maybe Nina was not like her grandmother at all, but simply a younger version of Beck&#x2014;a possibility too scary to contemplate.<br><br>(ii)<br><br>Lights on her tail. Was she being followed?<br><br>A wiser woman, Beck told herself, would have dismissed such a notion as the sort of nonsense that always sneaked into her head when she thought about Jericho. In the chilly night hours on a lonely and lightless mountain road, however, when the same pair of headlights kept slipping in and out of the fog, it was easier to be fearful than wise.<br><br>She accelerated&#x2014;no easy matter for the little rental car&#x2014;and the headlights vanished. She slowed to round a curve, and they were behind her again.<br><br>&#x201c;How do you know they&#x2019;re the same headlights?&#x201d; she sneered.<br><br>She just knew. She knew because the years had slipped away and she was back in Jericho&#x2019;s world, a world where a canoodling couple at the next table in a restaurant at a resort in Barbados meant you were under surveillance, where the maid at the Ritz planted bugs in the bedroom, where unexpected cars in the middle of the Yucat�n were packed with terrorists ready to exact revenge for your earnest defense of your country.<br><br>She reminded herself that Jericho&#x2019;s paranoia no longer guided her life, but her foot pressed harder anyway, and the little car shuddered ahead. She shot down into the valley and passed through half a town. It began to snow. She climbed again, breasted the rise, went around a curve, and suddenly was suspended in nothing.<br><br>No headlights behind her, no road in front of her.<br><br>Then she almost drove over the cliff.<br><br>Things like that happened in the Rockies, not metaphorically but in reality, especially in the middle of the night, when you daydreamed your way into an unexpected nighttime snowstorm&#x2014;unexpected because in Beck&#x2019;s corner of the country, the worst that ever happened in April was rain. At ten thousand feet, as she was beginning to remember, the weather was different. One moment, hypnotized by the cone of her headlights as it illuminated the shadowy road ahead and the dark trees rushing by on either side, Beck was gliding along, totting up the errors of her life; then, before she realized what was happening, heavy flakes were swirling thickly around her, and the road had vanished.<br><br>Rebecca slowed, then slewed, the front end mounting an unseen verge, the rear end fishtailing, but by then her winter smarts had returned, and she eased the wheel over in the direction of the skid. The car swiveled and bumped and came to rest ten yards off the road. She sat still, breath hitching. No headlights behind her, or up on the road, or anywhere else.<br><br>&#x201c;False alarm,&#x201d; Beck muttered, furious at herself for having let Jericho back into her head, gleefully whispering his mad cautions.<br><br>She set the brake and opened the door and found, to her relief, that she was not in a ditch or a snowbank. She could back the car uphill onto the tarmac. But turning around would be easier, if there was room. Shivering as the cold leached into her fashionable boots, she squinted ahead, checking to make sure that she had room enough. The whirl of snow was slowing. She had trouble judging the distance. The beams of her headlights were swallowed up by a stand of conifers dead ahead, but there was plenty of room. Except, when she looked again, the trees were a forest, and miles away, on the other side of a steep gorge. Her toes skirted the edge. She shuffled backward. Had she tried to turn around instead of backing up, she would likely have gone over.<br><br>There in a nutshell was life since Jericho: backing up and backing up, never taking chances. One plunge over the cliff was enough for any life.<br><br>Beck stood at the edge and peered into the yawning darkness. High up on the opposite slope, she could pick out what had to be the lights of Jericho&#x2019;s vast house. His family wealth had purchased the property, and the scandal of their relationship had sentenced him to life imprisonment within. She had dropped out of college. He had dropped out of much more. She did the arithmetic, all the presidential ears into which he had whispered his devious advice. She remembered the year they met, the start of his indefinite sabbatical from public life, spent among the lawns of Princeton, the hushed and reverent tones in which the faculty murmured Jericho&#x2019;s name. She remembered how his seminars were interrupted almost weekly by protesters branding him a war criminal; and the relish with which he had baited his young accusers, demanding that they explain which of the regimes he was alleged to have overthrown they would have preferred to preserve, and why.<br><br>Since leaving government service, Jericho had published half a dozen books on international politics, but nobody cared any more. Hardly anyone remembered who he was, or had been. Not two months ago, she had found his recent nine-hundred-page tome on the achievement of peace in the Middle East remaindered at Barnes &amp; Noble, going for three dollars and ninety-nine cents.<br><br>Her cell phone vibrated on her hip. Beck was surprised. Usually there was no service up here, but every now and then one found a patch of mountain digitally linked to the rest of the world. She fished the phone from her jacket. The screen said the number was unknown. When she answered, she got a blast of static in her ear, followed by a whine like a fax signal. Annoyed, she cut off the call. The phone immediately rang again, another unknown number, the same screech in her ear. No third ring. She decided to test her momentary connectedness by checking her messages, but when she tried she had no bars.<br><br>So how had whoever it was called her? She walked back and forth in the clearing, but found no service anywhere.<br><br>Never...</p><h2>Prentice Hall Conceptual Physics, Laboratory Manual, Teacher&#39;s Edition, 9780130542588, 013054258X, 2002</h2><p>2002 Prentice Hall Conceptual Physics: The High School Physics Program -- Laboratory Manual Teacher&#39;s Edition (TE)(P) ***Features: *Contains 99 Activities and Experiments *Includes Laboratory Safety Guidelines *Activities Are Designed to Provide Hands-on Experience That Relates to Specific Concepts *Exploratory Activities and Experiments Encourage Students to Observe Relationships, Identify Variables, and Develop Tentative Explanations *Concept-Development Activities and Experiments Are Based on Experiences Acquired from Exploratory Activities and Experiments *Application Labs Allow Students to Analyze Phenomena Using the Simple Models Formulated During Exploratory Labs and Clarified During Concept Developmetn *Answers and Sample Responses Are Provided ***ISBN-13: 9780130542588 ***Pages: 367</p><p></p><h2>Revolution from Within</h2><p><b>For decades, Gloria Steinem has led a social revolution against injustice. In <i>Revolution from Within </i>-- called "the ultimate self-help book" by the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> -- she sets out to restore the self-authority that such injustice has undermined. </b><br>"A fine triumph...Succeeds in holding the feminist course while expanding its horizons to include everyone." --<i>Time</i><i><br></i>"<i>Revolution from Within </i>has a special sweetness -- that of triumph. Gloria Steinem dared to look behind the bravely smiling face she presented to the world for many years to encounter a not-so-bravely-smiling inner self. This meeting will strike sparks of recognition and encouragement." --Alice Walker, author of <i>The Color Purple</i></p><p>In a quest for a sense of inner contentment and self-worth, Gloria Steinem brings the reader on a journey of investigation and discovery. Steinem reads the text herself in a straightforward and friendly, but not intimate, presentation which is so easy to listen to it invites repetition�thus ensuring the painless relearning of the lessons of the book. It&#39;s difficult to tell from the reading that this audiobook is abridged; each section can stand alone. Nonetheless, the listener wished the book were unabridged. Steinem left me wanting to learn more. C.R.W. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineIn the wake of such feminist calls-to-arms as Susan Faludi's Backlash (p. 1133), Paula Kamen's Feminist Fatale (p. 1137), and Naomi Wolf's The Beauty Myth (p. 389), Steinem's inwardly turned examination of how men and women sabotage themselves by suppressing the ``child within'' appears decidedly retro. Nevertheless, her reflections on her own and others' spiritual struggles may give a new generation of activists pause for further reflection. In the wake of Ms. magazine's sale and her own resignation as its editor, Steinem found herself, she says, with the time and inspiration to write a book she'd had in mind for years--a study of the psychological and societal factors that negatively influence self-esteem. The result, she tells us, was a heavily footnoted, scholarly report whose reliance on experts' opinions revealed Steinem's own deep lack of confidence, and inspired her to toss away her original manuscript and come out of the closet herself. Recounting her own early life as the daughter of a factory worker who divorced his mentally ill wife when Gloria was only ten, Steinem details the natural progression from a co-dependent relationship with her mother to an unconscious adult sense of being ``co-dependent with the world.'' Forced by her need to wall off her past, she led a life of outer-world confrontations until, through therapy undertaken as research for her book, she began to master her ``inner child.'' By including others' tales of self- actualization through a ``revolution from within''--the creation of a winning chess team in Spanish Harlem, the transformation of a housewife into an entrepreneur, etc.--Steinem illustrates how others' psychic journeys may lead in much different directions than her own. Still, much of what is recommended here will strike many as old hat--and, in the end, more interesting as an update on the feminist's life than as a practical aid to others. A piquant counterpoint to recently revitalized, outer-directed feminist fashion. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

"Does that mean you're out?"<br><br>"No, Clare. That's another kind of ball game."<br><br>"I hope you're talking about the Yankees."<br><br>"What do you think?"<br><br>"I think you should give up pitching woo and pitch in behind this counter . . ."<br><br>We were short-staffed this evening with every caf&#x17d; table occupied, the coffee bar packed, and a line of customers spilling into the chilly West Village night. Couples who couldn't find seats were sipping their lattes on the cold sidewalk.<br><br>According to my young baristas, the reason for this bounty of business was a hot new "dating game" application for smartphones. Hot was the operative word, since the app was called Cinder. This one included "user ratings" for the best public meeting places in the city, and we currently ranked in the top three.<br><br>Now that our landmark coffeehouse was a hookup hot spot for digital dating, my quiet evenings at the Village Blend displayed all the tranquility of a Times Square crosswalk.<br><br>"I'll work a shift," Matt told me. "But I'm not aproning-up until you caffeinate me."<br><br>"You want a single?" I asked.<br><br>"Make it a Red Eye."<br><br>The Red Eye aka "Shot in the Dark" was the barista's answer to the bartender's boilermaker, a jolty combination of espresso poured into a cup of high-caffeine light roast. It wasn't for the faint of heart. But then neither was my ex-husband.<br><br>A legend in the trade, Matteo Allegro was among the most talented coffee hunters in the world, as comfortable on a yacht floating in Portofino as in a muddy Jeep flirting with the edge of the Andes on Bolivia's infamous Death Road.<br><br>Adrenaline wasn't his only drug. During our marriage, he became addicted to cocaine while partying too hard below the equator. I helped him kick that deadly habit but failed to dent his other addiction-women.<br><br>Matt generated enough heat around the world's coffee belt to increase global warming, which is why I made the mature decision to put our marriage on ice. Even so, his behavior tonight seemed excessive. Who makes three dates in one night? And how could Matt have possibly struck out on all of them?<br><br>The very idea was (I had to admit) amusing. Not that anyone's rejection deserved to be mocked. On the contrary, I did my level best to suppress the surging wisecracks.<br><br>My raven-haired barista Esther, on the other hand, did not share my overactive conscience. From her perch at the register, she propped a hand on her ample hip and targeted Matt through her black-framed glasses.<br><br>"Did I hear right?" she asked. "The prince of passion was passed over? The sultan of seduction shunned? The archduke of desire dumped?"<br><br>"Hard to believe, I know . . ." With a smirk, Matt pushed his sweater's sleeves up tanned and sculpted forearms. "But even the best swingers foul out from time to time."<br><br>"I saw your first two dates vacate your table," Esther said. "I lost track of the third. What was the reason for the last heave-ho? She's a vegan and you eat veal?"<br><br>"No. The vegan was Mindy, an hour ago."<br><br>"What about the redhead at eight thirty?"<br><br>"She said I reminded her of her ex."<br><br>"And the little blonde who just left? Why didn't she like you?"<br><br>"Actually, she did. I reminded her of her father."<br><br>"Ouch."<br><br>I tried not to laugh-and failed.<br><br>Matt noticed. "You're enjoying this, aren't you?"<br><br>"I'm sorry," I said. Hoping to make it up to him, I slid over his Red Eye. "Here you go, made with love."<br><br>Matt took a long hit and sighed. Then he laid his rosebud on the counter like a carnation on a coffin-and picked his smartphone back up.<br><br>"Hey! You agreed to help us back here, remember?"<br><br>Matt's focus didn't falter. "Just one more check of my Pumpkin Pot."<br><br>"Your what?"<br><br>Esther rolled her eyes. "He's talking about that stupid Cinder app."<br><br>With a deep breath for patience, I went back to work behind the espresso machine. Three cappuccinos and two hazelnut mochas later, the man was still swiping.<br><br>"Enough!" I grabbed the phone.<br><br>That got his attention. "What's with the hostility?"<br><br>"I'm not hostile!" A few heads turned, and I lowered my voice. "Okay, maybe I'm a little hostile. This swipe-to-select coupling, and all these amped-up matches-it's like romance on Red Eyes. In my view, love should not be a sport."<br><br>"Not a sport, Clare, a game . . ." Snatching back his phone, Matt waved me closer. "Check this out-"<br><br>Like a little boy with a new toy, he showed off the screen. The word Cinder crackled in red letters, tongues of flame licking the edges. Below the logo were colorful animations-a glass slipper, fluttering fairy, and pulsing pumpkin-floating as innocently as Disney props.<br><br>Matt's finger stroked the tiny pumpkin. It jiggled and bounced, then grew and grew. Fairy dust fell from the digital sky, and the pumpkin transformed into a royal carriage with a purple banner reading-<br><br>TODAY'S CINDER-ELLAS!<br><br>Thumbnail images of a dozen women flew out the carriage door and formed a grid pattern. Matt tapped one of them, and a profile opened, showing an attractive woman with a forced coquettish smile, bangs arranged over one eye with great determination.<br><br>"I just swiped this Ella into my Pumpkin Pot. If she swipes my profile right by midnight tomorrow, I'll get a Tinkerbell notification."<br><br>"A what?"<br><br>"It means she sent him a Glass Slipper, dear." The reply came not from Matt but from his mother-Madame Dreyfus Allegro Dubois.<br><br>The beloved octogenarian owner of this century-old family business was in fine form this evening, sporting tailored wool slacks and a cashmere sweater the color of textured latte milk. Her silk scarf, printed with Edgar Degas's Dancers in Violet, brought out that very hue in her eyes, which appeared livelier than usual in our shop's soft evening light.<br><br>As Matt greeted his mother with a kiss on both cheeks, I pulled her a fresh espresso. "What brings you here so late?"<br><br>"I have a rendezvous!"<br><br>"With Otto?" I assumed since she'd been seeing the gallery owner for some time. But she shook her head.<br><br>"Otto's consultation work in Europe is ongoing. He and I agreed to keep things loose. And you know I'll need an escort for your wedding-once you and your blue knight finally decide on a venue."<br><br>"Believe me, we're trying."<br><br>"So . . ." She waved her smartphone. "I'm swiping to meet!"<br><br>"You're using Cinder?"<br><br>"Don't be silly! I use the Silver Foxes dating app. That software allows either sex to make the first move."<br><br>Matt's eyebrow arched. "Maybe I should try it."<br><br>"Heavens no, it's not for children! The user age starts at sixty-five."<br><br>Esther snorted. "Hear that? In twenty short years, Mr. Boss will have a date."<br><br>Matt waved his phone. "More like twenty seconds."<br><br>Tinker-Tinker!<br><br>"See!" he said with renewed vigor-and thumb typing.<br><br>"What just happened?" I asked Esther.<br><br>"Cinder sent him a Tinkerbell notification."<br><br>"Of what? The approach of Captain Hook?"<br><br>"It's just a glorified text message," Esther explained, "telling him a woman wants to communicate with him. In Cinder-speak they call it a Glass Slipper. Only a Cinder-ella can send a slipper to a Cinder-fella. That's one reason the app has become so hot."<br><br>Matt nodded. "Contrary to the Connie Francis song, boys go where the girls are, and more women are on Cinder than any other app. They feel safer making the first move, and I'm happy to let them. Once they swipe me right, Tinkerbell alerts me, and we can set up a date to see if-"<br><br>"The Glass Slipper fits. I get it."<br><br>"And if it does . . ." Matt grinned. "We're on our way to the . . . uh-hem ball. That's Cinder-speak for going to-"<br><br>"I get that, too. But what happens if Ms. Pumpkin Pot swipes left on you instead of right?"<br><br>"Then we're done. Accept-Reject. Win-Lose. It's that simple."<br><br>"Simple? Or reductive? The decision to accept or reject a human being is being made on a few pictures and a paragraph!"<br><br>"So?" Matt halted his thumb-typing. "Look, it's no different than meeting a prospective partner in a bar or at a party. You check each other out, flirt a little, and you hit it off-or you don't. The app just makes the party bigger."<br><br>"One must keep up with the times, dear," Madame advised with a wink. Then she finished her espresso and tossed us a farewell wave. "My Silver Fox is in the coop!"<br><br>"I don't disagree with your mother," I told Matt when he finally joined us behind the counter. "Keeping up with change is smart-from a practical standpoint. But there are larger issues to consider."<br><br>"Like what?"<br><br>"Like change isn't always for the better, especially when it involves human nature."<br><br>Matt scoffed, but Esther countered-<br><br>"Ms. Boss ain't wrong. I read an article by a social scientist who believes these dating apps are artificially turbo-boosting the 'hit-it-and-quit-it' culture, devolving excessive users into the addictive cycle of Skinner box animals."<br><br>"See?"<br><br>Matt waved away my concern. As he tied on his apron, he pointed to his mother, who was already happily on her way out the door with her dapper-looking date. Then he challenged me to prove this "devolution" theory with a concrete example.<br><br>I couldn't. Not then. Within the hour, however, one of our customers did it for me . . .<br><br>I was sipping an espresso on a much-needed break when-<br><br>BANG!<br><br>The sound of a single gunshot tore through our upstairs lounge.<br><br>Looking back, I shouldn't have been so shocked. A new mate with every swipe meant the old one was tossed away. When it happens enough times, anyone's candy-store excitement could turn sour, even bitter. Binary code could connect continents, but it couldn't reprogram people, delete our fears and frailties. Or erase our potential for violence . . .<br><br>At the sound of that bang upstairs, everyone on the main floor quieted, the sea of faces going blanker than a dead smartphone screen.<br><br>Was that really a gun?<br><br>BANG! BANG! BANG!<br><br>With three more shots, chaos ensued. Freaked-out bodies stampeded the exit in unstoppable waves, and I bobbed amid the panic like a cork in the Atlantic.<br><br>"Clare!" Matt shouted, leaping over the counter. "Where are you?"<br><br>"I'm here!" I jumped up to show him and, on the next bounce, screamed a gentle suggestion to-<br><br>"Call the police!"<br><br>Two<br><br>As frantic patrons flowed around me, I noticed something disturbing (apart from the gunfire and mass exodus). Not a single person had come down from the second floor.<br><br>I pushed my way through the crowd until I'd reached the bottom of our spiral staircase. It stood like a wrought-iron sculpture, still and empty. Peering up, I saw no one and quickly climbed three steps for height.<br><br>Across the retreating sea of humanity, Matt was calling 911. When our eyes met, I pointed to the ceiling, my meaning clear-<br><br>I'm going up!<br><br>Matt's eyes bugged and he fervently shook his head.<br><br>I knew he wanted me to wait for the police, but I couldn't sit by and do nothing. One of my other baristas, Dante Silva, was up there, along with a floor of innocent customers.<br><br>Was this a hostage situation? Or someone's idea of a joke? Were people terrorized and injured? Or was this simply a misunderstanding?<br><br>Whatever was going down, I was determined to have a look, and (if possible) try to help. This was my coffeehouse, my staff, my responsibility.<br><br>"You take the service stairs!" I mouthed to Matt before starting my climb.<br><br>As I crested the top, I slowed my movements, entering the lounge in a crouched position. I spotted Dante's shaved head and tattooed arms in a small crowd of gawking patrons.<br><br>Finally, I saw who they were gawking at.<br><br>A slender woman stood near the middle of the room. She was about my daughter's age. Her white silk blouse looked virginal over her pink flowered skirt. Honey blond hair fell to her twenty-something shoulders.<br><br>I'd seen her several times in our coffeehouse. She seemed a shy type, always sat alone-though she sometimes conversed with Tucker Burton, my assistant manager. On those visits, her willowy arms had sported a fashionable handbag or tote. Tonight, those limbs appeared to be accessorized with a semiautomatic handgun.<br><br>"DON'T YOU EVER LAUGH AT ME AGAIN. GOT IT?!"<br><br>Her shrill threat was directed at a man in his thirties. Cornered and cowering in a high-back Victorian chair, the guy appeared to be dressing for success in a designer skinny suit and open-collared shirt. His brown hair was threaded with salon-golden highlights, and the cut looked trendy-close-cropped on the sides with the thick, longish top slicked back.<br><br>I'd seen this man a few times over the past week-in the company of several different women-though I couldn't be sure, since his hands were raised in front of him and his head was turned at an angle that effectively hid his face.<br><br>"I'll shoot you next time instead of the ceiling! How would you like that? A bullet right into your heart. Or maybe your smirking mouth. Or better yet, how about down there?"<br><br>Wisely, Mr. Bullseye elected not to take the multiple-choice quiz.<br><br>"Maybe I should shoot you down there. Then you'll know how painful it is to be shot down!"<br><br>Tinker-Tinker!<br><br>The man's smartphone had fallen onto the ground and lay near his expensive loafers, along with a pen and a few bits of paper. When it sprang to life, so did he. In a stunningly brainless move, he lunged to answer it.<br><br>"No! Don't you touch that phone!!"<br><br>With a savage kick, the young woman sent the device flying. Then she slapped the man's head with her gun. He gave a yelp and curled back farther into the chair.<br><br>"I won't let you degrade another woman. I'd rather see you dead! Do you understand? DEAD!"<br><br>About then, I noticed something that alarmed me (even more than this mini Italian opera). My barista Dante began to inch closer to the female shooter and her loaded gun.<br><br>Bad idea.<br><br>This young woman hadn't shot anyone. Not yet, anyway.<br><br>Was she disturbed? Yes.<br><br>Homicidal? Maybe.<br><br>Enraged? Absolutely-at the guy in front of her, and that was the point. She was obviously reacting to some kind of rejection from this man, which made me certain that another man wasn't the answer to helping her see reason.</p><h2>Star Wars Epic Yarns: A New Hope</h2><p>Share your love of <em>Star Wars</em> with your baby!

It took us nearly a year to create all the <i>Star Wars</i> figures and spaceships in wool, build all the scale-model sets, and do all the in-studio or on location photography.

Trapped on a narrow, unstable frozen ledge, deep below daylight and high above a yawning chasm, he would desperately battle crumbling ice and snow that threatened to bury him alive, while struggling in vain to save his fatally injured companion.

His first book was the international-award-winning </em>Forever on the Mountain<em> (2007) and his most recent was </em>Blind Descent.<em> A former Washington, DC police officer, Tabor now lives in Vermont where he is at work on his first novel, </em>The Deep Zone. <p>On June 21, 1992, Jim Davidson, 29, and his best friend and climbing partner, Mike Price, 34, summited 14,410-foot Mt. Rainier via the challenging Liberty Ridge route. While descending, Davidson plunged into an 80-foot-deep crevasse and pulled his rope-partner Price in, too. Price died, Davidson survived, and <em>The Ledge</em> is Davidson&#x2019;s painstakingly detailed account of their accident, written 19 years <em>post facto</em>.</p> <p>Hundreds of books have described climbing tragedies in such detail. Two things set the best apart. One is the attempt to look beyond obvious vagaries of gear, weather, and happenstance to discover tragedy&#x2019;s true, dark roots. The other is an equally strong determination to bring something of value back from the brink. These are much harder quests and, to his credit, Davidson tackles both.</p> <p>That detail, first. Davidson recreates the fatal fall and aftermath as though they happened yesterday, thanks to hours of recollections tape-recorded shortly after the event. That&#x2019;s important, because on one level, such the success of such narratives depends on details as sharp as ice shards. An example will suffice. After he hit bottom, buried beneath and completely immobilized by cascading snow and ice, Davidson could not breathe.</p> <p><em>I suck in hard, trying to grab a breath, but my mouth is half-filled with crunchy snow, so I pull in only a small gulp of air. I try chewing the snow to clear it away, but it is too much, as if someone has stuffed a Popsicle into my mouth. I work my jaw and tongue, struggling to push out the rapidly hardening snow clump. But it turns into a dense lump the size of a plum. When I rest for a second, the snowball settles back in my throat and gags me. </em></p> <p>Having had no chance to save his friend, Davidson had to save himself by climbing out of the crevasse, and the odds against him were long. Davidson was injured, exhausted, and probably in shock. He lacked both the requisite technical aid-climbing experience and most of the proper gear. But he drew strength from recollections of Joe Simpson&#x2019;s against-all-odds self-rescue in <em>Touching the Void</em>. After many hours of struggle, Davidson finally climbed back to the surface. Even then, the ordeal was far from over. It was late and getting dark. He was hurt and had no gear and was alone on a glacier riddled with more crevasses. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m out, but I&#x2019;m not safe,&#x201d; Davidson acknowledged.</p> <p>That turned out to be true in more ways than one. Though he survived and eventually recovered physically, Davidson continued to suffer from psychic injuries, survivor&#x2019;s guilt chief among them. In his journal, he wrote, &#x201c;How am I to carry this load alone--the self-doubt, the endless questioning? How can I hope to carry it alone?&#x201d; Mike Price haunted his thoughts and dreams and, laudably, Davidson eschewed the more common rites of exorcism: chemical, alcohol, and compensatory self-sacrifice. Instead, over the months, he went <em>mano a mano</em> with every painful &#x201c;what if&#x201d; and found his measure of solace:</p> <p><em>Each decision, action, and bit of luck is a fork leading to different outcomes, different branches. Some are sturdy and hold fast, some creak under your weight, some fracture and drop you into unexpected turmoil.</em></p> <p>Not perfect, perhaps, but certainly good enough to live with.</p> <p>Making personal peace with the tragedy was good, but left missing one last arc in the circle of healing. Could something of value be distilled from all the loss and agony? As it turned out, yes. &#x201c;While I was in the crevasse, Joe Simpson&#x2019;s survival tale convinced me that there was a remote chance to escape, and that belief helped spur me to action. Perhaps I have an obligation to share my story...&#x201d;</p> <p>After securing permission from Mike Price&#x2019;s parents, Davidson spoke to his first live audience in September, 2003 at the annual Rainier Mountain Festival. Afterward, among the many grateful listeners was a middle-aged mother with two daughters. &#x201c;I wanted them to hear it,&#x201d; she told Davidson. &#x201c;Now if they&#x2019;re in an accident...they&#x2019;ll know how much people can do, that we can do incredible things if we try our hardest.&#x201d; And with that, the circle was complete. Since then, according to his publisher, Davidson has delivered his message to more than 30,000 people. <em>The Ledge</em> is part of his ongoing commitment to Mike Price--and to himself--to find meaning in the heart of tragedy.</p> <p>Someone once said that for true value, &#x201c;a book must be about more than it is about.&#x201d; Jim Davidson&#x2019;s <em>The Ledge</em> is. You can read it as a thrilling, chilling tale of adventure and death in the mountains, but it is, ultimately, about more than that. As, come to think of it, are climbing and mountains themselves.</p> <p></p><b>Jim Davidson</b> is an accomplished climber, speaker, and science writer.

So wrote&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i> of Tim O'Brein's&nbsp;&nbsp;now classic novel of Vietnam. Winner of the 1979&nbsp;&nbsp;National Book Award, <i>Going After&nbsp;&nbsp;Cacciato</i> captures the peculiar blend of horror and&nbsp;&nbsp;hallucinatory comedy that marked this the strangest&nbsp;&nbsp;of wars. Reality and fantasy merge in this&nbsp;&nbsp;fictional account of one private's sudden discussion to&nbsp;&nbsp;lay down his rifle and begin a quixotic journey&nbsp;&nbsp;from the of Indochina to the streets of Paris. Will&nbsp;&nbsp;Cacciato make it all the way? Or will he be yet&nbsp;&nbsp;another casualty of a conflict that seems to have no&nbsp;&nbsp;end? In its memorable evocation of men both&nbsp;&nbsp;fleeing and meeting the demands of the battle,&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Going After Cacciato</i> stands as much more&nbsp;&nbsp;than just a great war novel. Ultimately it's about&nbsp;&nbsp;the forces of fear and heroism that do battle in&nbsp;&nbsp;the hearts of us all.</p><p><i>"In October, near the end of the month, Cacciato left the war."</i><p> In Tim O'Brien's novel <i>Going After Cacciato</i> the theater of war becomes the theater of the absurd as a private deserts his post in Vietnam, intent on walking 8,000 miles to Paris for the peace talks. The remaining members of his squad are sent after him, but what happens then is anybody's guess: "The facts were simple: They went after Cacciato, they chased him into the mountains, they tried hard. They cornered him on a small grassy hill. They surrounded the hill. They waited through the night. And at dawn they shot the sky full of flares and then they moved in.... That was the end of it. The last known fact. What remained were possibilities." </p><p> It is these possibilities that make O'Brien's National Book Award-winning novel so extraordinary. Told from the perspective of squad member Paul Berlin, the search for Cacciato soon enters the realm of the surreal as the men find themselves following an elusive trail of chocolate M&amp;M's through the jungles of Indochina, across India, Iran, Greece, and Yugoslavia to the streets of Paris. The details of this hallucinatory journey alternate with feverish memories of the war--men maimed by landmines, killed in tunnels, engaged in casual acts of brutality that would be unthinkable anywhere else. Reminiscent of Joseph Heller's <i>Catch-22</i>, <i>Going After Cacciato</i> dishes up a brilliant mix of ferocious comedy and bleak horror that serves to illuminate both the complex psychology of men in battle and the overarching insanity of war. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>"Simply put, the best novel written about the war. I do not know any writer, journalist, or novelist who does not concede that position to O'Brein's <i>Going After Cacciato</i> " -- <i>The Miami Herald</i>. <p>"Stark... rhapsodic... brilliant... it is a canvas painted vividly, hauntingly, disturbingly by Tim O'Brien." -- <i>Los Angeles Times</i></p></p><h2>What&#39;s for Dinner?: Delicious Recipes for a Busy Life</h2><p>Curtis Stone, host of Bravo's hugely popular <i>Top Chef Masters</i> and <i>Around the World in 80 Plates</i>, provides a culinary road map of time-saving kitchensolutions and delicious dishes for every day of the week.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We're all busy.

That means second helpings, extra glasses of wine, and the gooiest chocolate desserts. Well, the weekend has ended, and it&#x2019;s time to turn over a new leaf. I&#x2019;m a huge believer in the idea that when you start the week off right, you&#x2019;re more likely to end it better as well. My work with contestants on The Biggest Loser taught me many things, but none more important than the power of positive temptation. We crave what we see, whether it&#x2019;s a pan of brownies or a bowl of fresh raspberries. So start by washing some fruit and putting it out on the counter, your desk, or anywhere in your line of sight. Then cut up your favorite veggies and keep them in a container nearby. When you&#x2019;re itching for a snack, the fruit and vegetables will be as easy to grab as a bag of chips.<br><br>One of the rewards of cooking dinner is putting together a beautiful plate of food. And while I love family-style dining, where everyone serves themselves from platters and bowls, plating each person&#x2019;s meal is a great way to ensure portion control. If I see a bowl of mashed potatoes on the table, I guarantee you I&#x2019;m going back for seconds.<br><br>Just remember that healthy eating is about balance, not deprivation. You don&#x2019;t need to skimp on flavor to eat food that&#x2019;s good for you. Let this chapter be your positive temptation. Cook with seasonal ingredients, which pack extra zest, and use fresh herbs. That vibrant touch of green brings food to life. In addition to containing herbs, the recipes in this chapter rely on lean proteins, whole grains, and tons of vegetables&#x2014;even some you may have never tried&#x2014;to make satisfying Monday meals that&#x2019;ll help you put your best foot forward.<br><br>A main-course salad brimming with lots of vegetables and lean meat is one of my favorite ways to put a healthy meal on the dinner table. This one is on the spicy side, with arugula leaves and peperoncini (pickeled Italian peppers) in the citrusy vinaigrette. The zucchini ribbons, which look like wide pappardelle pasta, have an appetizing, fresh texture and look beautiful on the plate. When weather permits, cook the chicken breasts on an outdoor grill.<br><br>Grilled Chicken with Arugula and Zucchini Salad with Lemon-Caper Vinaigrette<br><br>serves 4<br><br>Prep Time: 15 minutes<br><br>Cooking Time: 10 minutes<br><br>Lemon-Caper Vinaigrette<br><br>2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots<br><br>Finely grated zest of 1 lemon<br><br>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice<br><br>1 tablespoon coarsely chopped drained nonpareil capers<br><br>1 tablespoon finely chopped peperoncini<br><br>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley<br><br>2 teaspoons champagne vinegar or white wine vinegar<br><br>W cup extra-virgin olive oil<br><br>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br><br>Chicken<br><br>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (about 6 ounces each)<br><br>1 tablespoon olive oil<br><br>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br><br>Salad<br><br>5 ounces baby arugula (about 8 cups not packed)<br><br>1 cup halved cherry tomatoes<br><br>2 small, thin zucchini<br><br>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br><br>1 To make the vinaigrette: In a medium bowl, whisk the shallots, lemon zest, lemon juice, capers, peperoncini, parsley, and vinegar together. Gradually whisk in the olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.<br><br>2 To cook the chicken: Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Coat the chicken with the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the chicken for about 4 minutes per side, or until it is seared with grill marks and shows no sign of pink when pierced in the thickest part with the tip of a small sharp knife. Transfer to a cutting board.<br><br>3 To assemble the salad: In a large bowl, combine the arugula and tomatoes. Trim the ends of the zucchini. One at a time, lay the zucchini flat on a work surface and, using a vegetable peeler and working from the stem end to the blossom end, shave off long, thin ribbons until you reach the seedy center. Turn the zucchini around and repeat on the second side, then repeat on the third and fourth sides. Add the ribbons to the bowl and discard the seedy centers of the zucchini.<br><br>4 Using your hands to avoid breaking the ribbons, gently toss the salad with enough vinaigrette to coat. Season with salt and pepper.<br><br>5 Cut each chicken breast crosswise into thirds. Transfer a cut chicken breast to each dinner plate and heap some of the salad alongside. Drizzle the chicken and salad with the remaining vinaigrette and serve immediately.<br><br>This dish is a far cry from the common diet dinner of broiled chicken breasts and steamed broccoli. It starts with chicken and continues with lots of spinach, cucumber, and onion, along with aromatics such as ginger, garlic, and curry powder. It adds up to a highly flavorful meal with a generous amount of sauce, to leave you feeling totally fulfilled.<br><br>Chicken Masala with Cucumber Raita<br><br>serves4<br><br>Prep Time: 10 minutes<br><br>Cooking Time: 45 minutes<br><br>Chicken<br><br>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves (about 6 ounces each)<br><br>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br><br>1/4 curry powder, such as Madras<br><br>3 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed<br><br>1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced<br><br>3 tablespoons finely chopped, peeled fresh ginger<br><br>5 garlic cloves, finely chopped<br><br>One 28-ounce can whole tomatoes with juices, squeezed to coarsely crush<br><br>1 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth<br><br>One 6-ounce package fresh baby spinach leaves<br><br>1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro<br><br>Raita<br><br>3/4 cup plain low-fat Greek yogurt<br><br>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh cilantro<br><br>Finely grated zest of 1 lemon<br><br>1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice<br><br>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br><br>1 cucumber, peeled, halved lengthwise, and seeded<br><br>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br><br>Perfect Basmati Rice (page 10), for serving<br><br>1 To cook the chicken: Season the chicken with salt and pepper, then rub 2 tablespoons of the curry powder all over it. Heat a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the 3 tablespoons oil, then add the chicken and cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until browned on both sides. Transfer to a plate and set aside. Reduce the heat to medium.<br><br>2 Add the onions to the pan and saut� for about 3 minutes, or until they begin to soften. Stir in the ginger, garlic, and the remaining 2 tablespoons curry powder and cook, stirring often, for about 2 minutes, being careful not to burn the mixture. If the pan is dry, add another teaspoon of oil. Add the tomatoes and their juices and season with salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes, or until the onions are tender.<br><br>3 Stir in the broth and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes to thicken the sauce slightly and blend the flavors. Nestle the chicken into the sauce and simmer gently, turning it once, for about 5 minutes per side, or until the chicken is opaque when pierced in the thickest part with the tip of a small sharp knife. Season to taste with salt and pepper.<br><br>4 Meanwhile, make the raita: In a medium bowl, whisk the yogurt, cilantro, lemon zest, lemon juice, and cumin to blend. Using the fine holes of a box grater, grate the cucumber into the yogurt mixture. Stir to blend and season to taste with salt and pepper.<br><br>5 Transfer each chicken breast half to a dinner plate. Stir the spinach into the sauce and cook for about 2 minutes, or until it wilts. Stir in the cilantro.<br><br>6 Spoon the sauce over the chicken and serve with the rice and raita.<br><br>Perfect Rice<br><br>Rice is the perfect canvas for many dishes, ready to soak up a delicious sauce. There are many different kinds of rice sold in the market today. Aromatic rice, such as basmati or jasmine, has a more interesting flavor and texture than standard long-grain white rice, although the latter makes a reliable side dish for simply cooked chops and fish fillets. If your rice has boiled over in the past, it was probably because the pan was too small. Choose a saucepan that easily holds the rice and water with enough room for the rice to triple in size. Use a heavy-bottomed pan to keep the rice from sticking, and be sure the lid fits tightly. Serves 4<br><br>Prep Time: 5 minutes<br><br>Cooking Time: 15 to 20 minutes, plus 5 minutes standing time<br><br>1 cup long-grain white rice<br><br>11/2 cups water<br><br>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt<br><br>1 In a small heavy saucepan, bring the rice, 1V cups water, and salt to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan, and simmer gently for about 15 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Don&#x2019;t stir the rice during cooking, as this can release starches that will lead to sticking.<br><br>2 Fluff the rice with a fork and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes before serving.<br><br>VARIATION: PERFECT JASMINE OR BASMATI RICE Substitute jasmine or basmati rice for the white rice. Imported rice, such as basmati and jasmine, is often coated with a fine powder to protect it through long periods of storage during transport. The powder should be rinsed off before cooking the rice. Put the rice in a sieve and rinse under cold running water, stirring the rice with your hand, until the water runs relatively clear. Drain well and proceed. There&#x2019;s no need to rinse domestic long-grain white rice.<br><br>The aromas from this dish&#x2014;roasting chicken, with sweetness from the squash&#x2014;evoke autumn. It just smells like a comforting and indulgent family dinner from my childhood. With those memories in mind, I created this main-course salad with its pleasing mix of bitter, crunchy, and sweet by pairing roasted kabocha with endives and apples. Part of eating well is experimenting with new choices to expand your horizons.<br><br>Fennel-Roasted Chicken and Winter Squash with Endive-Apple Salad<br><br>serves 4<br><br>Prep Time: 15 minutes<br><br>Cooking Time: 35 minutes<br><br>Chicken and Squash<br><br>8 chicken thighs (with skin and bones)<br><br>2 tablespoons fennel seeds, coarsely crushed (use a mortar and pestle or crush under a heavy skillet)<br><br>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br><br>1 small or 1/2 large kabocha or acorn squash (about 21/4 pounds), halved if whole, seeded, and cut into 1-inch-wide wedges<br><br>2 tablespoons olive oil<br><br>Tarragon-Dijon Vinaigrette<br><br>3 tablespoons cider vinegar<br><br>3 tablespoons minced shallots<br><br>2 tablespoons honey<br><br>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard<br><br>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh tarragon<br><br>W cup extra-virgin olive oil<br><br>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper<br><br>Salad<br><br>6 ounces Belgian endive (about 2 heads),<br><br>5 ounces baby arugula (about 8 cups not packed)<br><br>1 Fuji or Gala apple, cored and very thinly sliced<br><br>3/4 cup walnuts, toasted (see Chef&#x2019;s Note, page 123), and very coarsely chopped<br><br>3/4 cup coarsely crumbled blue cheese<br><br>1 To roast the chicken and squash: Preheat the oven to 450�F.<br><br>2 On a large heavy baking sheet, toss the chicken with 1 tablespoon of the fennel seeds to coat.

Roast the chicken on the bottom shelf of the oven for 10 minutes.<br><br>3 Meanwhile, on another large heavy baking sheet, toss the squash with the oil and the remaining 1 tablespoon fennel seeds to coat. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange the squash cut side down in a single layer on the baking sheet.<br><br>4 Move the chicken to the top shelf of the oven and place the squash on the bottom shelf. Roast for 25 minutes, or until the squash is tender and the undersides are deep golden brown and the chicken shows no sign of pink when pierced at the bone with the tip of a small sharp knife.<br><br>5 Meanwhile, make the vinaigrette: In a medium bowl, whisk the vinegar, shallots, honey, mustard, and tarragon until blended. Whisk in the oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper.<br><br>6 To assemble the salad and serve: Remove hard cores from the endive. Cut the small leaves in half lengthwise, and quarter the large leaves lengthwise. In a large bowl, toss the endive, arugula, and apple slices with about half of the vinaigrette. Divide the salad among four dinner plates. Top each with 2 chicken thighs and some squash, and sprinkle with the walnuts and blue cheese. Drizzle the remaining vinaigrette over and around the salads and serve immediately.<br><br>Who doesn&#x2019;t love meatballs in basil-scented tomato sauce? But who would have thought that they could still be on the family table when you are trying to eat healthfully? These are so juicy and satisfying that you won&#x2019;t need the pasta. The recipe makes fairly large meatballs with a generous amount of sauce, allowing for a single ball per serving.

That Something was there before we were born, before our present formation, and it will still be there after oiur transformation. It is constantly active. We think that that Something is somewhere else but the fact is, that Something of beginningless beginnings and endless ends, boundless, mysterious, is centered here in ourselves." This book is about the Something, our Buddha Nature, the ultimate Reality. What is this essence of life? How can we experience it? Why is it so important to do this? What effect will this experience have in our daily lives? For these Points of Departure, we can enter and continue the study and practice of Zen with a firm step.

On a summer night, police recover the body of a young woman from an abandoned pleasure boat drifting around the Stockholm archipelago.

Her heart beats faster and she darts a look over her shoulder. Perhaps she feels a sense of foreboding of what&#x2019;s to come as her day progresses.<br>In spite of the television studio&#x2019;s heat, Penelope&#x2019;s face feels chilled. Maybe the sensation is left over from her time in makeup when the cold powder puff was pressed to her skin and the peace-dove hair clip was taken out so they could rub in the mousse that would make her hair fall in serpentine locks.<br>Penelope Fernandez is the spokesperson for the Swedish Peace and Reconciliation Society. Silently, she is being ushered into the newsroom and to her spotlighted seat across from Pontus Salman, CEO of the armaments manufacturer Silencia Defense AB. The news anchor Stefanie von Sydow is narrating a report on all the layoffs resulting from the purchase of the Bofors Corporation by British BAE Systems Limited. Then she turns to Penelope.<br>&#x201c;Penelope Fernandez, in several public debates you have been critical of the management of Swedish arms exports. In fact, you recently compared it to the French Angola-gate scandal. There, highly placed politicians and businessmen were prosecuted for bribery and weapons smuggling and given long prison sentences. But here in Sweden? We really haven&#x2019;t seen this, have we?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, you can interpret this in two ways,&#x201d; replies Penelope. &#x201c;Either our politicians behave differently or our justice system works differently.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You know very well,&#x201d; begins Pontus Salman, &#x201c;that we have a long tradition of&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;According to Swedish law,&#x201d; Penelope says, &#x201c;all manufacture and export of armaments are illegal.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re wrong, of course,&#x201d; says Salman.<br>&#x201c;Paragraphs 3 and 6 of the Military Equipment Act,&#x201d; Penelope points out with precision.<br>&#x201c;We at Silencia Defense have already gotten a positive preliminary decision.&#x201d; Salman smiles.<br>&#x201c;Otherwise this would be a case of major weapons crimes and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But, we <i>do</i> have permission.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget the rationale for armaments&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Just a moment, Penelope.&#x201d; Stefanie von Sydow stops her and nods to Pontus Salman, who&#x2019;s lifted his hand to signal that he wasn&#x2019;t finished.<br>&#x201c;All business transactions are reviewed in advance,&#x201d; he explains. &#x201c;Either directly by the government or by the National Inspectorate of Strategic Products, if you know what that is.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;France has similar regulations,&#x201d; says Penelope. &#x201c;And yet military equipment worth eight million Swedish crowns landed in Angola despite the UN weapons embargo and in spite of a completely binding prohibition&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not talking about France, we&#x2019;re talking about Sweden.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I know that people want to keep their jobs, but I still would like to hear how you can explain the export of enormous amounts of ammunition to Kenya? It&#x2019;s a country that&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You have no proof,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Nothing. Not one shred. Or do you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Unfortunately, I cannot&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You have no concrete evidence?&#x201d; asks Stefanie von Sydow.<br>&#x201c;No, but I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then I think I&#x2019;m owed an apology,&#x201d; says Pontus Salman.<br>Penelope stares him in the eyes, her anger and frustration boiling up, but she tamps it down, stays silent. Pontus Salman smiles smugly and begins to talk about Silencia Defense&#x2019;s factory in Trollh�ttan. Two hundred new jobs were created when they were given permission to start production, he says. He speaks slowly and in elaborate detail, deftly truncating the time left for his opponent.<br>As Penelope listens, she forces aside her anger by focusing on other matters. Soon, very soon, she and Bj�rn will board his boat. They&#x2019;ll make up the arrow-shaped bed in the forecabin and fill the refrigerator and tiny freezer with treats. She conjures up the frosted schnapps glasses, and the platter of marinated herring, mustard herring, soused herring, fresh potatoes, boiled eggs, and hardtack. After they anchor at a tiny island in the archipelago, they&#x2019;ll set the table on the afterdeck and sit there eating in the evening sun for hours.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Penelope Fernandez walks out of the Swedish Television building and heads toward Valhallav�gen. She wasted two hours waiting for a slot in another morning program before the producer finally told her she&#x2019;d been bumped by a segment on quick tips for a summer tummy. Far away, on the fields of G�rdet, she can make out the colorful tents of Circus Maximus and the little forms of two elephants, probably very large. One raises his trunk high in the air.<br>Penelope is only twenty-four years old. She has curly black hair cut to her shoulders, and a tiny crucifix, a confirmation present, glitters from a silver chain around her neck. Her skin is the soft golden color of virgin olive oil or honey, as a boy in high school said during a project where the students were supposed to describe one another. Her eyes are large and serious. More than once, she&#x2019;s heard herself described as looking like Sophia Loren.<br>Penelope pulls out her cell phone to let Bj�rn know she&#x2019;s on her way. She&#x2019;ll be taking the subway from Karlaplan station.<br>&#x201c;Penny? Is something wrong?&#x201d; Bj�rn sounds rushed.<br>&#x201c;No, why do you ask?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s set. I left a message on your machine. You&#x2019;re all that&#x2019;s missing.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No need to stress, then, right?&#x201d;<br>As Penelope takes the steep escalator down to the subway platform, her heart begins to beat uneasily. She closes her eyes. The escalator sinks downward, seeming to shrink as the air becomes cooler and cooler.<br>Penelope Fernandez comes from La Libertad, one of the largest provinces in El Salvador. She was born in a jail cell, her mother attended by fifteen female prisoners doing their best as midwives. There was a civil war going on, and Claudia Fernandez, a doctor and activist, had landed in the regime&#x2019;s infamous prison for encouraging the indigenous population to form unions.<br>Penelope opens her eyes as she reaches the platform. Her claustrophobic feeling has passed. She thinks about Bj�rn waiting for her at the motorboat club on L�ngholmen. She loves skinny-dipping from his boat, diving straight into the water, seeing nothing but sea and sky.<br>She steps onto the subway, which rumbles on, gently swaying, until it breaks out into the open as it reaches the station at Gamla Stan and sunlight streams in through the windows.<br>Like her mother, Penelope is an activist and her passionate opposition to war and violence led her to get her master&#x2019;s in political science at Uppsala University with a specialty in peace and conflict resolution. She&#x2019;s worked for the French aid organization Action Contre la Faim in Darfur, southern Sudan, with Jane Oduya, and her article for <i>Dagens Nyheter</i>, on the women of the refugee camp and their struggles to regain normalcy after every attack, brought broad recognition. Two years ago, she followed Frida Blom as the spokesperson for the Swedish Peace and Reconciliation Society.<br>Leaving the subway at the Hornstull station, Penelope feels uneasy again, extremely uneasy, without knowing why. She runs down the hill to S�der M�larstrand, then walks quickly over the bridge to L�ngholmen and follows the road to the small harbor. The dust she kicks up from the gravel creates a haze in the still air.<br>Bj�rn&#x2019;s boat is in the shade directly underneath V�ster Bridge. The movement of the water dapples the gray girders with a network of light.<br>Penelope spots Bj�rn on the afterdeck. He&#x2019;s got on his cowboy hat, and he stands stock-still, shoulders bent, with his arms wrapped closely about him. Sticking two fingers in her mouth, she lets loose a whistle, startling him, and he turns toward her with a face naked with fear. And it&#x2019;s still there in his eyes when she climbs down the stairs to the dock. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; she asks.<br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; he answers, as he straightens his hat and tries to smile.<br>As they hug, she notices his hands are ice-cold and the back of his shirt is damp.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re covered in sweat.&#x201d;<br>Bj�rn avoids her eyes. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been stressful getting ready to go.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Bring my bag?&#x201d;<br>He nods and gestures toward the cabin. The boat rocks gently under her feet and the air smells of lacquered wood and sun-warmed plastic.<br>&#x201c;Hello?

Written in Boston while she was just a teenager, and when she was still a slave, Wheatley&#x2019;s work was an international sensation. In <i>Phillis Wheatley</i>, Vincent Carretta offers the first full-length biography of a figure whose origins and later life have remained shadowy despite her iconic status.</p><p>A scholar with extensive knowledge of transatlantic literature and history, Carretta uncovers new details about Wheatley&#x2019;s origins, her upbringing, and how she gained freedom. Carretta solves the mystery of John Peters, correcting the record of when he and Wheatley married and revealing what became of him after her death. Assessing Wheatley&#x2019;s entire body of work, Carretta discusses the likely role she played in the production, market�ing, and distribution of her writing. Wheatley developed a remarkable transatlantic network that transcended racial, class, political, religious, and geographical boundaries. Carretta reconstructs that network and sheds new light on her religious and political identities. In the course of his research he discovered the earliest poem attributable to Wheatley and has included it and other unpublished poems in the biography.</p><p>Carretta relocates Wheatley from the margins to the center of her eighteenth-century transatlantic world, revealing the fascinating life of a woman who rose from the indignity of enslavement to earn wide recognition, only to die in obscurity a few years later.</p></p><p>VINCENT CARRETTA is a professor of English at the University of Maryland. He is the author or editor of more than ten books, including scholarly editions of the writings of Olaudah Equiano, Phillis Wheatley, Ignatius Sancho, and Ottobah Cugoano. His most recent books are<i> Equiano, the African: Biography of a Self-Made Man</i>, winner of the Annibel Jenkins Prize, and <i>The Life and Letters of Philip Quaque, the First African Anglican Missionary</i>, coedited with Ty M. Reese (both Georgia).<p>This is a satisfying study of the &#x2018;elusive&#x2019; Wheatley, fleshed out with succinct, discerning readings of the body of her work. . . . Especially noteworthy is the book&#x2019;s attentiveness to Wheatley&#x2019;s involvement in the production and promotion of her book, the contemporary responses to her work, and an unprecedented account of her marriage to the debt-ridden John Peters, whose death forced her into domestic service.</p> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review))<br><br><p>Surprisingly the first full biography ... Carretta presents his significant research in this comprehensive study of Wheatley. He uncovered her previously unknown earliest writings in the personal papers of a contemporary. Using court documents about her husband, John Peters, Carretta found new information about Wheatley&#x2019;s postemancipation life in Boston and London, years about which scholars still know very little. He also provides fresh analysis of Wheatley&#x2019;s poetry and gives the reader a glimpse into the lives of both free and enslaved blacks in Colonial New England.</p> (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br><p>Phillis Wheatley is a much too little-known figure, but at last she has found the right biographer. Those who have admired the clear, informed and judicious light that Vincent Carretta has already shed on the life and work of Olaudah Equiano will find the same qualities in this book. His deep knowledge of both shores of the eighteenth-century Atlantic make him the perfect person to bring alive this remarkable woman and the world of bondage and wary freedom in which she lived.</p> (Adam Hochschild <i>author of<i> Bury the Chains: Prophets and Rebels in the Fight to Free an Empire&#x2019;s Slaves</i></i>)<br><br><p>Phillis Wheatley is one of the very few women writers to have invented a literary tradition. Lavishly praised and viciously maligned, the enormity of Wheatley&#x2019;s artistic achievements has long been obscured by the political uses to which she and her poetry have been put. Even more obscured have been the details of Wheatley&#x2019;s life. At last, Vincent Carretta has written a biography of this great writer as complex and as nuanced as Wheatley and her work themselves. This book resurrects the 'mother' of the African American literary tradition, vividly, scrupulously, and without sentimentality, as no other biography of her has done.</p> (Henry Louis Gates Jr. <i>Alphonse Fletcher University Professor, Harvard University, and author of <i>The Trials of Phillis Wheatley: America's First Black Poet and Her Encounters with the Founding Fathers</i></i>)<br><br><p>[Carretta's] wellresearched narrative succeeds in bringing the 'genius in bondage' out of history's shadows. . . . Wheatley emerges from the pages of Carretta's biography as a resourceful poet who played an active role in the production and distribution of her own writing on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> (Douglas Field <i><i>Times Literary Supplement</i></i>)<br><br><p>Phillis Wheatley for a generation has been a vehicle for ideological warfare. Was this first internationally recognized African-American poet a race traitor or the spiritual foremother of anti-materialism, post-racial amity, and gracious community? In the heat of the argument Phillis Wheatley herself melted into near insignificance. Vincent Carretta&#x2019;s biography brings the person&#x2015;her life&#x2015;career&#x2015;literary context&#x2015;marriage&#x2015;illness&#x2015;religious life&#x2015;death&#x2015;back into startling view. With his characteristic depth of new research and scrupulously even-handed assessment of evidence, Carretta makes us understand the milestones of her transit from slavery to freedom, from a local curiosity to an international celebrity. We see for the first time her earliest attempts at verse. We finally grasp the drama and negotiation surrounding her return to America from the virtual freedom of post-Mansfield decision England. We understand the dynamics of the transatlantic abolition movement and its support of her efforts. We encounter her husband John Peters as a complex entrepreneurial man, not a one-dimensional exploiter and cad. We grasp why the advertised second volume of poems&#x2015;one of the great lost books of American literature&#x2015;never came to press. In short, we come to know Phillis and her world in a way we were never able to before.</p> (David S. Shields <i>McClintock Professor, University of South Carolina</i>)<br><br><p>An extraordinary achievement. Carretta's ground-breaking research and sensitive readings greatly enrich our understanding of Wheatley's life and work.</p> (John Wood Sweet <i>author of<i> Bodies Politic: Negotiating Race in the American North, 1730-1830</i></i>)<br><br><p>Such scholars as Vincent Carretta, in <i>Phillis Wheatley</i>, find her poetry more nuanced than her modern black critics have allowed. . . . Phillis Wheatley is a reminder that African-American literature began not as autobiography or protest but religious poetry, the literature of yearning. Phillis Wheatley was special, but her poetry was not. It earned her a place among the white contregants of her church precisely because it behaved, conformed. There is a speed and rhythm in her letters that is personal, whereas a poem by her can sound like the eighteenth-century poem next to it by someone else. We leave her, thirsting for the upper courts of the Lord.</p> (Darryl Pinckney <i><i>Harper's Magazine</i></i>)</p><h2>BBQ USA: 425 Fiery Recipes from All Across America</h2><p>Steven Raichlen, a national barbecue treasure and author of The Barbecue!

N. Reynolds, Clarence King, George Wallace Melville, and John Muir. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Aaron Sachs is a professor of history and American studies at Cornell University and an award- winning environmental journalist. This is his first book.American history of the 19th century is dominated by the Civil War, the expansion to the Pacific and the push to industrialization, but it is worth recalling the prominent interest in natural history in the U.S., a movement of which the tremendously popular Prussian scientist Alexander von Humboldt (1769&#x2013;1859) was more or less the first practitioner. Arguably the Einstein of his day in terms of fame, accomplishment and influence, the explorer and author of the magisterial work <i>Cosmos</i> had a huge impact on American environmentalism. This ambitious subject is admirably tackled in this complexly argued book by Sachs, an environmental journalist and history professor at Cornell. Sachs cannily divides the book into the four points of the compass, addressing East (Europe's influence), South (excursions to Antarctica), West (exploring the frontier) and North (failed attempts to conquer the North Pole). The author chooses four explorer-naturalists&#x2014;J.N. Reynolds, Clarence King, George Wallace Melville and John Muir&#x2014;to represent the various tributaries of Humboldt's considerable influence. In this timely read, he even documents the naturalist impulse in writers such as Thoreau, Whitman and, surprisingly, Poe. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Although he doesn't slight Provincetown as a geographical place, he appreciates that it's the people who have put Ptown on the map, and he has chosen a selection of them to capture the aura of the town: a Portuguese fisherman who managed to get caught for every (substantial) infraction, social and legal, he has committed; a woman preservationist whose work affords a glimpse into the workings of the town government; a police chief who kept the rule of law through a precarious balance of when to look and when not to; bar owners and drug smugglers; lost souls; and those who have found their true selves. The art community gets thorough coverage, starting back with the summer schools of art in the late-19th century through the time when the town served as home base for Abstract Expressionists, then Pop artists, and a whole gallimaufry of current painters. Some of Manso's most insightful material concerns the evolution of the gay community, from its birth to its polymorphous diversity, and particularly its politics, which have always perked strongly: laid-back, radical, progressive, commercial, correct, incorrect. Manso endeavors, and mostly succeeds, to give each voice a fair hearing, providing good doses of history, whether of the fishing industry, the tourist trade, or the extraordinary explosion in real estate values that has, in the past few years, utterly changed the face of the town and the composition of the population. </p><p>In a place that has always valued liberty over law, Manso has caught the intriguing angles that let him shed light on the heart of Ptown."</p><b>Peter Manso</b> has lived in Provincetown for most of his life, beginning in the early 1950s.

These chemicals, alone or in combinations, interfere with the processes that our body needs to perform to maintain health and vitality. In many cases they cause symptoms that are then diagnosed as diseases for which more chemicals are prescribed, thus perpetuating or worsening the situation. We plan our work, we plan our vacations, we plan our retirement and some of us even plan our funerals. But very few of us plan our wellbeing. It is no wonder most of us are sick and have to end up at the doctor&#39;s office where our symptoms are treated with more chemicals, or surgery, causing further frustration, suffering and disease. Like Global Warming, this awareness is only now beginning to dawn on us, and is still ignored or denied by traditional western medicine.

In May, 1862, he and eight crew members commandeered the boat and, after stopping to pick up family members, "defected" to the Yankees. He went on to become a hero in the African American community and a U.S. Congressman. Cooper brings his story to life quite well, elucidating the confusing era of Reconstruction so that it is easily understood. The book includes a good glossary and black-and-white reproductions.

This dazzling and distinctive style, with its emphasis on up-to-date individuality combined with good taste, fine materials, and exquisite workmanship, soon created new standards in furniture design, architecture, and the decorative arts. In furniture especially, the French predominated, from the virtuoso cabinet-making of Ruhlman to the brilliant originality of Gray and Legrain.<br><br> In <em>Art Deco Furniture</em>, Alastair Duncan introduces us to the work of eighty-five French architects, interior designers, and furniture makers. These pioneering designers replaced the heavy, stylized work of the past with furniture that was simpler in concept, geometric in form, and highlighted by dramatic lines and elegant curves. The color and monochrome photographs&#x2015;almost all of them specially commissioned for this book&#x2015;form a valuable portfolio of Art Deco furniture. This detailed study serves as both an essential reference book for collectors and a marvelous chronicle of one of the most exciting design movements in the history of the decorative arts. 312 illustrations, 68 in color</p><p>Alastair Duncan was for fourteen years associated with Christie&#39;s, New York, latterly as a Consultant.

Eisenhower's public image was that of a wide-grinning Daddy Warbucks who preferred the golf course over the cabinet room. He was perceived as a military bureaucrat who never held a combat command. A Republican sandwiched between two Democratic administrations, he lacked the political vigor of his predecessor Harry S. Truman and the star quality of his successor JFK. </p><p>Yet behind the placid image he was a sly fox who ran the most efficient espionage establishment in the world. His goal was to keep the Free World free. To do so, he fostered the growth of the CIA, overthrew governments, flew spy flights, and hatched assassination plots. At the top of the intelligence pyramid, Ike shouldered some of the greatest coups in espionage history, as well as some of its most ignominious failures. </p><p>Among Ike's successes: The "Man Who Never Was" strategem, the ULTRA-guided ambush of the German counterattack at Mortain, which opened the Allies' way to the Rhine, the 1954 overthrow of Jacobo Arbenz Guzman's government of Guatemala, Operation AJAX, which toppled Iran's Mossadegh, and the U-2 flights over Russia. But Ike can be credited likewise for miscalculations: the failure to predict the German attack during the Battle of the Bulge, the Francis Gary Powers fiasco, and the tragic and irresponsible encouragement of freedom fighters in Hungary, Indonesia, and Cuba. </p><p>In writing this revealing probe into the 1950s spy world, Stephen E. Ambrose, the author of the most acclaimed full-scale biography of Eisenhower, interviewed the president and many of his agents and had access to much previously unpublished archival material. "The story he tells," said the New York Review of Books in 1981 when the book was first published, "is one of some very low deeds done in the name of high moral principles." </p><p>Stephen E. Ambrose was Director Emeritus of the Eisenhower Center, Boyd Professor of History at the University of New Orleans, and president of the National D- Day Museum. He was the author of many books, most recently <i>The Mississippi and the Making of a Nation: From the Louisana Purchase to Today</i>. His compilation of 1,400 oral histories from American veterans and authorship of over 20 books established him as one of the foremost historians of the Second World War in Europe. He died October 13, 2002, in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi.</p></p><p><p>Behind Ike&#x2019;s grandfatherly mask, the free world&#x2019;s foremost spymaster</p><b>Stephen E.

Yet in this remarkable book, James Kugel shows that this God is not the same as the God of most of the Hebrew Bible, the God who appeared to Abraham, Moses, and other biblical heroes. That God, the &#34;God of Old,&#34; was actually perceived in a very different way -- a way that has much to teach modern believers. James Kugel is renowned for his investigations into the history of the biblical era, a time beginning more than three thousand years ago, when the Bible&#39;s earliest parts first took shape. Now he goes even deeper, attempting to enter the spiritual world of ancient Israelites and see through their eyes God as they encountered him. The God of Old appeared to people unexpectedly; He was not sought out. Often He was not even recognized, at first mistaken for an ordinary human being. The realm of the divine was not as it is today -- a spiritual dimension set off from the material world. The spiritual and the material overlapped, and the realm of the dead was a real domain just beyond the world of the living. Ordinary reality was in constant danger of sliding into something else, something stark but oddly familiar. God was always standing just behind the curtain of the everyday world. Kugel suggests that this alternative spirituality is not simply an archaic relic, replaced by a &#34;better&#34; understanding. Kugel&#39;s picture of the God of Old has much to tell us about God&#39;s very nature, and about the encounter between Him and human beings in today&#39;s world. This is a book to treasure side by side with the Bible, and for years to come.</p><p><b>James L. Kugel</b> is Starr Professor of Hebrew Literature at Harvard University, and Professor of Bible Studies at Bar-Ilan University in Israel. He is the author of a number of books of biblical scholarship, including <i>The Great Poems of the Bible</i> (1999) and <i>The Bible As It Was</i> (1997). In 2001, Kugel was awarded the prestigious Gawemeyer Prize in Religion. He lives in Jerusalem, Israel, and in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<p><b>Chapter One: The Project</b> </p><p> My field is the study of ancient texts. I have spent the better part of my life working on them, mostly texts from the Hebrew Bible, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and other writings of the ancient Near East, but also Hebrew texts from the middle ages. One thing I have learned through my years of studying is that authors, although they are writing on some specific topic and for some definite purpose, often end up telling more than they set out to. Especially if a text is of any length or substance, it can open a window onto the inner world of the person who wrote it, revealing something crucial about how that person saw and understood things in general. Such information is often far more valuable than whatever it was the author had consciously set out to write about. The reason is that the author himself, and all the things he thought were obvious or took for granted, are by now long gone. The text is the only thing we have that will allow us to enter that lost world and, with some effort, restore its way of understanding, of <i>seeing.</i> The trick, of course, is to know how to allow a text to tell everything it knows about its author and his world. </p><p> This afternoon, I was in the library studying a poem written by a Hebrew poet of the middle ages. It is a poem about the soul, and reading it, I thought again of the Project. People in medieval times had such a vivid sense of their own souls! We often accuse ourselves nowadays of self-absorption, self-obsession, and there is more than a little truth to this. But in medieval times, even though the self in which they were absorbed was quite different, people were as aware as we are today, perhaps even more so, of what was going on deep inside themselves. They sometimes said that they felt their soul was "sick" and needed tender caring. They said they felt it, <i>felt</i> it, crying out in distress. Like a lovesick maiden (though, one might add, with the intensity of a dog chained to a stake), it was sobbing and moaning in its frantic desire to be reunited with its Creator. Some of this may have been literary convention, poetic boilerplate, but behind that must have been a certain reality in their world that has disappeared from our own. I thought of the dusty treatises I had once consulted, with their prescriptions for the soul's care and betterment, a diet of devotion and medicinal herbs, proper readings, and a path of penitence to bring the soul back to its native strength. </p><p> Outside the library, one comes to one's senses: the traffic, the brightly lit stores. But still, always lurking, is the Project. What is the Project? It is not mine in particular; many people have worked at it. Perhaps it began for me at the time of the Vietnam War, or perhaps even before that. Events conspire to put you on the spot, to cause you to make some fateful decision. And just then, facing life's ugly, jagged teeth, you suddenly feel a certain calm and a sense of the realness of things that isn't there most of the time, the realness of yourself as one distinct person, and certain ideas go through your head. A few years pass, perhaps. Then, on a day that you have set aside, sitting alone on a park bench above some municipal lake, you try to smooth things out in your mind, until the surface of the lake subtly starts to seem like an image of your mind, and once again you have a different sense of things. It is then that the Project can present itself most forcefully, reemerging from wherever it may have been waiting. The Project is: to get to the bottom of this, to see how far it goes; not to deceive oneself, not to be sentimental or weak, but to see how far one can go. </p><p> It can take you very far, even fill up a lifetime. Oddly, for me, it led eventually to (among other places) a most unlikely setting, the library. The reason is implied in what I have already said. I did not invent the idea of the soul, or of God, I was not the first to write about Him. Those who were, and those who followed them, lived long ago, and now all that remains of their world is those texts that they left behind. At first they seem so dry and dead, but if they are read in the right way -- with sympathy and imagination, no condescension, only a relentless desire to enter -- they can indeed come back to life, and their world, their way of seeing, can let us in to take the measure of things that are strange. </p><p> Copyright � 2003 by James Kugel</p></p><h2>Father Water, Mother Woods</h2><p>Survival in the wilderness--Gary Paulsen writes about it so powerfully in his novels <i>Hatchet </i>and<i> The River </i>because he's lived it.&nbsp;&nbsp;These essays recount his adventures alone and with friends, along the rivers and in the woods of northern Minnesota.

Wistrich examines the long and ugly history of anti-Semitism, from the first recorded pogrom in 38 BCE to its shocking and widespread resurgence in the present day. As no other book has done before it, A Lethal Obsession reveals the causes behind this shameful and persistent form of hatred and offers a sobering look at how it may shake and reshape the world in years to come. <br><br>Here are the fascinating and long-forgotten roots of the &#x201c;Jewish difference&#x201d;&#x2013;the violence that greeted the Jewish Diaspora in first-century Alexandria. Wistrich suggests that the idea of a formless God who passed down a universal moral law to a chosen few deeply disconcerted the pagan world. The early leaders of Christianity increased their strength by painting these &#x201c;superior&#x201d; Jews as a cosmic and satanic evil, and by the time of the Crusades, murdering a &#x201c;Christ killer&#x201d; had become an act of conscience. <br><br>Moving seamlessly through centuries of war and dissidence, A Lethal Obsession powerfully portrays the creation of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the fateful anti-Semitic tract commissioned by Russia&#x2019;s tsarist secret police at the end of the nineteenth century&#x2013;and the prediction by Theodor Herzl, Austrian founder of political Zionism, of eventual disaster for the Jews in Europe.<br><br>The twentieth century fulfilled this dark prophecy, with the horrifying ascent of Hitler&#x2019;s Third Reich. Yet, as Wistrich disturbingly suggests, the end of World War II failed to neutralize the &#x201c;Judeophobic virus&#x201d;: Pogroms and prejudice continued in Soviet-controlled territories and in the Arab-Muslim world that would fan flames for new decades of distrust, malice, and violence.<br><br>Here, in pointed and devastating detail, is our own world, one in which jihadi terrorists and the radical left blame Israel for all global ills. In his concluding chapters, Wistrich warns of a possible nuclear &#x201c;Final Solution&#x201d; at the hands of Iran, a land in which a formerly prosperous Jewish community has declined in both fortunes and freedoms.<br><br>Dazzling in scope and erudition, <b>A Lethal Obsession </b>is a riveting masterwork of investigative nonfiction, the definitive work on this unsettling yet essential subject. It is destined to become an indispensable source for any student of world affairs.</p><p>Robert S. Wistrich is professor of modern European history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and head of its Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism. Previously, he held the Jewish Chronicle Chair of Jewish Studies at University College London and was visiting professor of history at Brandeis and Harvard universities. A regular contributor to the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>, he is the author of many books, including <i>Antisemitism: The Longest Hatred</i>, and scripted the PBS television series of the same name.<i>Chapter One<br>From Deicide to Genocide<br></i><br>There has been no hatred in Western Christian civilization more persistent and enduring than that directed against the Jews. Though the form and timing that outbursts of anti-Jewish persecution have taken throughout the ages have varied, the basic patterns of prejudice have remained remarkably consistent.1 Particularly striking is the deeply irrational and counterfactual character of most accusations that have been leveled against the Jewish people over the past two thousand years.2 As noted in the introduction, the Jews were charged with deicide (the killing of Christ), with piercing holy communion wafers to make them bleed (desecration of the host), and with the ritual murder of Christian children at Easter; they have been held responsible for poisoning wells and for the Black Death during the Middle Ages; for practicing witchcraft, forging an alliance with the mythical Antichrist, and conspiring to destroy Christendom.3 In modern times, new and no less sinister variations have been added to the theme of the "Jewish peril"-that Jews are striving for world domination by achieving control of the international financial system, by promoting revolutionary socialist ideologies, or through the alleged machinations of Zionism and the State of Israel. Modern anti-Semitism has thrived on irrational Manichean myths such as the Judeo-Masonic, the Judeo-Communist, or Zionist-American conspiracies, and the belief in an occult global Jewish power, embodied in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.4 The litany of stereotypes and accusations seems endless and has acquired a seemingly timeless quality, despite its lack of any empirical basis.<br><br>The persistence, longevity, and mythic power of such group hatred makes it an especially revealing barometer of the tensions and conflicts within European Christian culture where it was incubated. Moreover, the fact that anti-Semitism culminated in the Holocaust of World War II-the systematically planned mass murder of six million Jewish men, women, and children-is evidence of the extreme irrationality that has been one of its chief distinguishing features. The traumatic, cataclysmic nature of this event has sparked many attempts in the past sixty years to find theories and explanations that could illuminate anti-Semitism, racism, and the roots of murderous hatreds of the other in general.5 Yet despite the many contributions from historians, political scientists, sociologists, psychologists, theologians, and researchers in other disciplines, an element of mystery remains. There are factors in anti-Semitism that both derive from and yet clearly transcend the hatred of the different and the alien that are so characteristic of religious bigotry and racism in general. There are a number of parallels between Jew hatred and the persecution of heretics, witches, homosexuals, Gypsies, blacks, and other minorities, yet the sacral, quasi-metaphysical quality of anti-Semitism is singularly absent in the other cases. Moreover, some of the more obvious factors in racist prejudices, such as the legacy of colonial oppression, slavery, or economic exploitation, have only a very limited value in understanding the specificity of Judeophobia.<br><br>The paranoid power of anti-Semitic myth cannot, in fact, be understood without reference to its religious sources and deeper roots in classical antiquity. Moreover, as pointed out in the introduction, it cannot be separated from widespread Gentile resentment provoked by the Jewish sense of being a "chosen people" with a unique vocation that has made them appear unable to assimilate in the eyes of surrounding cultures. In the Jewish self- understanding, the people of Israel (later the Jews) had been delivered by God from Egyptian bondage and granted a law of freedom (the Decalogue, or Ten Commandments), which laid the moral foundations of human civilization. Though upbraided by their own prophets for disregarding this law (the Torah) and later punished by centuries of exile, the Jews never lost confidence in their divine mission, which was simultaneously particular and universal. However, for the leading pagan cultures of antiquity-Egyptian, Greek, and Roman-the chosenness of the Jews appeared to be something incorrigibly exclusivist and separatist, and more like a stubborn, intolerant, and incomprehensible resistance to cultural assimilation.6<br><br>In seeking the origins of the modern virus of anti-Semitism, the historian cannot ignore this ancient clash of civilizations.7 It contained many strands, from the animus of the Greco-Egyptian literati against Jews and Judaism in Alexandria to Roman brutality in suppressing Jewish revolts in the land of Israel and North Africa during the first centuries of the Common Era. Vulgar and intellectual anti-Semitism in the Hellenistic world could, moreover, always draw on the fact that no other nation in antiquity, apart from the Jews, so consistently refused to acknowledge the gods of its neighbors, partake in their sacrifices, and send gifts to their temples, let alone eat, drink, or intermarry with them.8 As if to compound the insult, Jews claimed superiority over the "heathens" in the religious sphere (something Judaism involuntarily bequeathed to Christianity and Islam)-committed as it was to a transcendent monotheistic faith and a rational code of ethics.<br><br>The Seleucid ruler Antiochus Epiphanes was especially irritated by the Jewish refusal to bow to the norms of Greek culture. In 168 b.c.e., he imposed the worship of Zeus in the Jewish Temple of Jerusalem and forbade the practice of Judaism.9 In Alexandria, in the three centuries before the Christian era, similar expressions of pagan anti-Semitism found a fertile soil among the populace and especially the Greco-Egyptian intelligentsia. For example, the Alexandrian Apion-taking his cue from the Egyptian priest Manetho- presented the Hebrews as a race of lepers cast out of Egypt in the days of Moses. Jewish civilization was depicted as sterile, and the Jews were derided as a superstitious godless people who were isolationists and filled with loathing for other gods. Once a year they allegedly kidnapped a Gentile Greek and fattened him up to be eaten by their deity in his Holy of Holies (an anticipation of the Christian ritual murder charge).<br><br>Not surprisingly, the first recorded pogrom of antiquity exploded in Alexandria in 38 c.e. at a time when Caligula was emperor in Rome.10 The rival Greek community accused the Jews, who represented almost 40 percent of the city's population, of being unpatriotic and of manifesting dual loyalties when the Aramaic-speaking Judean king Herod Agrippa I visited Alexandria. Long-standing envy at the Jews' position of privilege, wealth, and power, whipped up by professional agitators and abetted by the studied inaction of the Roman governor Flaccus, resulted in mob passions running riot.11 However, Flaccus did not respond to this violence by punishing the rioters. Instead, he stripped the Jews of their civic rights and herded them into a small quarter of the city-the first known ghetto in recorded history. Alexandria erupted again in 66 c.e., following news of the first Judean revolt against the Romans. When the mob seized three Jews in order to burn them alive, the whole Jewish community rose up to rescue them. The ensuing riot was ruthlessly crushed by the Roman governor, a Jewish apostate "whose troops reportedly killed 50,000 Jews."12 Similar long-standing frictions between Jews and non-Jews existed in the land of Israel during this period-notably in Caesarea, Ashkelon, and Jerusalem.<br><br>The anti-Semitism of classical antiquity was a complex phenomenon that would later provide the bedrock on which early Christian hostility to Jews could develop. As we have noted, it was in part a response to Jewish religious and social particularism-the strangeness (to Gentile minds) of the Jewish way of life and thought as prescribed by the Torah. Jews were seen as foreigners, and they unquestionably had very distinct customs; more than that, they were a monotheistic minority somehow surviving in dispersion. Yet this minority enjoyed a privileged status under Roman rule-especially in Alexandria-something that especially exasperated the local Greek population.13<br><br>However, relations with the Romans, despite periodic and ultimately explosive tensions, would remain reasonably good until the great Judean revolt against Rome of 66-70 c.e. Judah Maccabee contracted an alliance with Rome, and King Herod's ambitious expansion of Jerusalem during the time of Christ would have been impossible without Roman imperial support. Moreover, the Romans had recognized the right of Jews to practice their special worship and observances. The Roman authorities appreciated that Jews were an important element in their domains (10 percent of the population in the reign of Augustus and 20 percent in the eastern half of the Empire)-not worth antagonizing. Despite the bitterness of the three Jewish revolts against Rome (66-70 c.e., 115-17 c.e., 132-35 c.e.), the Roman state did, for the most part, continue to protect Jews from local anti-Semitic mobs who felt driven to violence by hatred, envy, or greed of plunder.<br><br>Anti-Jewish prejudices were nonetheless increasingly apparent in Roman writings of the first century. Seneca, Juvenal, Cicero, the historian Tacitus, and other great names of Latin literature repeated some of the more scurrilous accusations made in the older Greek anti- Jewish literature. Many Romans shared the Hellenistic repugnance against Jewish exclusiveness-distaste for circumcision, the dietary laws, and the Sabbath (merely a day of idleness to the jaundiced eye); they not infrequently embraced the claim that Jews hated the gods of other peoples and hence the rest of mankind (misanthropia).14 Moreover, as we have seen, the long-standing refusal of Jews to accept the imperial cult and deify the Roman rulers was an acute source of friction.15<br><br>First-century Roman intellectuals and writers were generally dismissive of Judaism as the ignorant "superstit...</p><h2>The Village Horse Doctor: West of the Pecos</h2><p>Ben K.

Now in Kellerman&#x2019;s most compelling and powerful novel yet, L.A. psychologist-detective Alex Delaware confronts a long-unsolved murder of unspeakable brutality&#x2014;an ice-cold case whose resolution threatens his survival, and that of longtime friend, homicide detective, Milo Sturgis.<br><br>The nightmare begins when Alex receives a strange package in the mail with no return address.

Alex can find no reason for anyone to send him this compendium of death, but when Milo views the book, he is immediately shaken by one of the images: a young woman, tortured, strangled, and dumped near a freeway ramp.<br><br>This was one of Milo&#x2019;s first cases as a rookie homicide cop: a vicious killing that he failed to solve, because just as he and his training partner began to make headway, the department closed them down.

While peeling back layer after layer of ugly secrets, they discover that the murder of one forgotten girl has chilling ramifications that extend far beyond the tragic loss of a single life.<br><br>A classic story of good and evil, sacrifice and sin, <i>The Murder Book</i> is a gripping page-turner that illuminates the darkest corridors of the human mind. It is a stunning tour de force.</p><p>When L.A. psychologist Alex Delaware receives an elaborate album filled with gruesome crime-scene police photos of a series of apparently unconnected killings, he's stymied. He's also in the midst of a personal crisis--Robin, his long-suffering partner, has made it clear that it's up to Alex to heal the breach in their relationship that's been caused by his over-involvement in criminal investigations. The pictures mean nothing to him, but one image gets his policeman pal Milo Sturgis's immediate attention--the victim was one of his rookie cases, and her murder was never solved, perhaps because someone much higher up in the department didn't want it to be. Was the anonymous mailer attempting to reach Milo through Alex? If so, the package has the desired effect, as the two men team up to find the connection between the cases highlighted in the murder book and whoever sent it. The trail leads to a retired cop, an old mentor of Alex's, and a wealthy, powerful family that will stop at nothing to keep its secrets and its victims buried forever. Kellerman pays more attention to Alex's midlife blues than he needs to, but his focus on Milo's experiences as a gay cop in a homophobic department fits seamlessly into both plot and narrative. <i>--Jane Adams</i><b>Jonathan Kellerman</b> is one of the world&#x2019;s most popular authors.

Were the crusades the Christian equivalent of modern jihad? In this sweeping yet crisp history, Thomas F. Madden offers a brilliant and compelling narrative of the crusades and their contemporary relevance. Placing all the major crusades within their medieval social, economic, religious, and intellectual environments, Madden explores the uniquely medieval world that led untold thousands to leave their homes, family, and friends to march in Christ&#39;s name to distant lands. From Palestine and Europe&#39;s farthest reaches, each crusade is recounted in clear, concise narrative. The author gives special attention as well to the crusades&#39; effects on the Islamic world and the Christian Byzantine East.</p><p><b>Thomas F. Madden</b> is professor in the Department of History and director of the Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies at Saint Louis University. He is the recipient of the Medieval Institute's Otto Gr�ndler Prize and the Medieval Academy of America's Haskins Medal. A widely recognized expert on the Crusades and Christian-Muslim conflict, he has written and spoken widely on the topic in such venues as the <i>New York Times</i>, National Public Radio, and PBS. He is the author of <i>A Concise History of the Crusades</i>, which was a Washington Post Book World Rave selection, <i>Enrico Dandolo and the Rise of Venice</i> and <i>The Fourth Crusade: The Conquest of Constantinople</i>, a History Book Club selection. He is the editor of <i>Crusades: The Illustrated History</i> and <i>The Crusades: The Essential Readings</i>. He resides in St. Louis, Missouri.Praise for the first edition:In little more than 200 pages, in crystal-clear and economical prose, Madden does a superb job of exposition. As an introduction to the vast literature of the crusades, this is a jewel of a book. It has all one needs to understand the epic nature of the various mobilizations and invasions, who the important players were and how they operated, and why what was for centuries romanticized as chivalrous has today become odious. (James Reston Jr. <i>Washington Post Book World</i>)<br><br>Praise for the first edition:Lucid, interesting, and lively. It certainly deserves to be listed in the bibliography for all undergraduate and school courses on the Crusades. (<i>Islam and Christian-Muslim Relations</i>)<br><br>Praise for the first edition:It is clear handling of a complex subject that lets the facts speak for themselves. The book, moreover, lives up to its title. It is concise, but not overly simplified. It would serve as a fine text for undergraduate history students. (<i>New Oxford Review</i>)<br><br>Praise for the first edition:A brilliant text and handbook for students, teachers, and all readers taking interest in the history of the Crusades. (<i>Byzantische Zeitschrift</i>)<br><br>Praise for the first edition:Readers will owe Thomas Madden warm thanks for so clear an introductory account of so complex a phenomenon as a crusade. (<i>The Historian</i>)<br><br>Praise for the first edition:Readers will be pleased that Thomas Madden has hit just the right note in his sweeping but concise account of the crusades. While he follows the development of crusading down to the period of the Protestant Reformation, and offers, in an afterword, speculations about the modern impact of the medieval crusade, he never fails to interest and inform. His prose is lucid. And to give the graphic point, he offers the reader fourteen clearly produced maps depicting the Mediterranean world about A.D. 1000, the routes of the main crusades, and the crusade plan of Maximilian I in 1518. The usefulness of these is reinforced by an index, a glossary, mainly of Islamic terms, a list of translated sources, and a select bibliography. (<i>The Catholic Historical Review</i>)<br><br>Praise for the first edition:A gripping narrative approach of the medieval social, economic, religious, and intellectual environments that gave birth to the Crusades and nurtured them for centuries. (<i>Missiology: An International Review</i>)<br><br>Praise for the first edition:Much praise is due to the author for giving us such a clear, concise picture of an ever-changing area of scholarship. (Patrick J.

It relates to the truth of numbers and magnitudes equally applicable to all sciences and arts. The book brings to light how great and true knowledge is born of intuition, quite different from modern Western method. The ancient Indian method and its secret techniques are examined and shown to be capable of solving various problems of mathematics. The universe we live in has a basic mathematical structure obeying the rules of mathematical measures and relations. All the subjects in mathematics--Multiplication, Division, Factorization, Equations, Calculus, Analytical Conics, etc.--are dealt with in forty chapters, vividly working out all problems, in the easiest ever method discovered so far. <br><br> The work, forms a class by itself, which is the result of the intuitional visualization of fundamental mathematical truth and principles during the course of eight years of highly concentrated mental endeavour on the part of the author. The question naturally arises as to whether the Sutras which form the basic of this treastise exist anywhere in the Vedic literature as known to us. However, the subject is not to be approached from a factual standpoint but from the ideal standpoint, viz., as the Vedas are traditionally accepted in India as the repository of all knowledge. This approach entirely turns tables on all critics, for the authorship of Vedic mathematics then need not be laboriously searched in the texts as preserved from antiquity. At any rate, it is needless to dwell longer on this point of origin since the vast merit of these rules should be a matter of discovery for each intelligent reader.</p><p>This book is a compilation of discourses, containing essentials of Vedanta, delivered by a saint-yogi and master of ancient Indian scriptures and also well-versed in modern sciences. Theses combine authenticity of thought with simplicity of language and will be suited to the modern mind. These discourses carry a message of eternal truth and a universal application and help the readers in their quest for the Supreme.</p><h2>Better Late Than Early: A New Approach to Your Child&#39;s Education</h2><p>this book is a result of research on the young child&#39;s mental development</p><p></p><h2>Three-Fisted Tales of &#34;Bob&#34;</h2><p>Stories depict the life of J.R. &#34;Bob&#34; Dobbs and the SubGenius church he founded after nuclear war decimated the Earth</p><p>The SubGeniuses, followers of a satiric pseudo-religion, worship J.

"Bob" Dobbs, the grinning, pipe-smoking salesman who, according to their legend, performs miracles, has sex with a four-ton giant slug and preaches a doctrine of "slack" (not being too disciplined). The myths of the SubGenii generally provide a platform for irreverent comment on government and religion. But this ragged collection of stories, all based on "church" lore, is devoid of literary merit. Many entries read as if they were stream-of-consciousness exercises assigned to male adolescents on LSD. Laser guns, spaceships, drugs, scantily clad women ("girls") and penises (sometimes multiple or gigantic) are the dominant images.

Beginning as early as the 1820s, artists and writers found new ways of thinking about the human relationship with the natural world along the Hudson. Here, amid the most dramatic river and mountain scenery in the eastern United States, Washington Irving and James Fenimore Cooper created a distinctly American literature, grounded in folklore and history, that contributed to the emergence of a sense of place in the valley. Painters, led by Thomas Cole, founded the Hudson River School, widely recognized as the first truly national style of art. As the century advanced and as landscape and history became increasingly intertwined in the national consciousness, an aesthetic identity took shape in the region through literature, art, memory, and folklore&#x2015;even gardens and domestic architecture. In Sanctified Landscape, David Schuyler recounts this story of America&#x2019;s idealization of the Hudson Valley during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. </p><p>Schuyler&#x2019;s story unfolds during a time of great change in American history. At the very moment when artists and writers were exploring the aesthetic potential of the Hudson Valley, the transportation revolution and the rise of industrial capitalism were transforming the region. The first generation of American tourists traveled from New York City to Cozzens Hotel and the Catskill Mountain House in search of the picturesque. Those who could afford to live some distance from jobs in the city built suburban homes or country estates. Given these momentous changes, it is not surprising that historic preservation emerged in the Hudson Valley: the first building in the United States preserved for its historic significance is Washington&#x2019;s Headquarters in Newburgh. Schuyler also finds the seeds of the modern environmental movement in the transformation of the Hudson Valley landscape. </p><p>Richly illustrated and compellingly written, Sanctified Landscape makes for rewarding reading. Schuyler expertly ties local history to national developments, revealing why the Hudson River Valley was so important to nineteenth-century Americans&#x2015;and why it is still beloved today.</p></p><p><p>David Schuyler is Arthur and Katherine Shadek Professor of the Humanities and American Studies at Franklin &amp; Marshall College. He is the author of <i>A City Transformed: Redevelopment, Race, and Suburbanization in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, 1940&#x2013;1980</i>;<i> Apostle of Taste: Andrew Jackson Downing, 1815&#x2013;1852</i>; and <i>The New Urban Landscape: The Redefinition of City Form in Nineteenth-Century America </i>and is an editor of <i>The Frederick Law Olmsted Papers</i>.</p><p>"In his capable and congenial history, David Schuyler, a humanities and American studies professor at Franklin and Marshall College, reminds us that the dance of change and permanence itself has been a constant throughout Catskill and Hudson Valley history."</p> (John Rowen <i>Kaatskill Life</i>)<br><br><p>"Schuyler has fashioned an absorbing account of the cultural milieu in which the Hudson Valley, a landscape of discrete villages, towns, and estates, was transformed into an iconic American region.... He adroitly foregrounds an abundant selection of contemporary sources testifying to the passionate sense of place these men exhibited in their professional and personal lives, as well as the influence most exerted, at least for a time, on the nation's aesthetic taste. Linking the Hudson Valley to early efforts of historic preservation and environmentalism, Schuyler commendably avoids the usual good-versus-evil narrative. The author's own sense of place is evident in illustrations and maps."</p> (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br><p>"Over the past two decades or so, David Schuyler has established himself as one of the nation's preeminent students of American landscape and planning history. Whether in dealing with the transformative nature of the forces that created urban landscapes or assessments of the fathers of landscape architecture in America, namely Frederick Law Olmstead and Andrew Jackson Downing, Schuyler&#x2019;s work has fashioned for us a deeper understanding and appreciation for the events, personalities, and forces that have made our environment what it is.... This is a fine and handsome book with lusciously reproduced paintings,wonderful reproductions of drawings and plans, and strong photographs. The quality reflects what university presses do better than most. In an era when many university presses are facing closure or are being downsized, a book of this nature is argument enough to embrace university presses for what they are: national treasures. And this book is a book about a national treasure itself, the mighty Hudson River. Thanks to David Schuyler and the Cornell University Press!"</p> (<i>Environmental History</i>)</p><h2>Attachment, Intimacy, Autonomy: Using Attachment Theory in Adult Psychotherapy</h2><p>Attachment theory is on the leading edge of a conceptual revolution. It offers a new paradigm that can synthesize into a more coherent whole the best ideas from psychoanalysis, cognitive science, and neurobiology. With its emphasis on relationships, attachment theory is determinedly humanistic, while retaining the scientific vigor of Darwinian ethnology. Attachment theory provides an overall framework for thinking about relationships, or more accurately, about those aspects of relationships that are shaped by threat and the need for security, themes that are central to the work of psychotherapy. In this book Jeremy Holmes explores the contribution of attachment theory to everyday psycho-therapeutic practice where patients are usually seen once weekly, or less, for no more than two to three years.</p><p><b>Jeremy Holmes, MD, MRCP, FRCPsych,</b> is currently a senior clinical lecturer at Bristol University Medical School. Dr. Holmes lectures widely in the UK and internationally, and has published seven books and over sixty papers on psychotherapy.Jeremy Holmes is the most significant contemporary theorist currently using attachment theory as a basis for psychotherapeutic practice. In this book he develops and amplifies Bowlby's original ideas by linking them to current work in child development and psychotherapy. In a crucial distinction, he shows that attachment and intimacy refer to different forms of relating which are developmentally connected, the form of attachment shaping the later style of intimate behavior. This maturation is related to the capacity for narrative. (Russell Meares)<br><br>Holmes not only gives clinicians a fundamental understanding of attachment theory but demonstrates its applicability to everyday practice concerns. By describing the characteristics of avoidant and ambivalent attachment, he helps therapists understand more fully the difficulties that patients have in achieving, maintaining, and thriving within a secure base. (Karen B. Walant)<br><br>Attachment theory has finally come into its own in the clinical setting. The conceptual framework provided by Bowlby, Ainsworth, and their successors has wide psychotherapeutic applications that are brilliantly described in this impressive work by Jeremy Holmes. Much that is chaotic in the clinical setting becomes clear and understandable when the principles of attachment theory are brought to bear. To the reader's great good fortune, Holmes's prose style is a model of clarity so that abstruse concepts are effortlessly grasped by the reader and the author's humanity shines through. (Glen O. Gabbard)</p><h2>Land and Environmental Art</h2><p>The traditional landscape genre was radically transformed in the 1960s when many artists stopped merely representing the land and made their mark directly in the environment. Drawn by vast, uncultivated spaces of desert and mountain as well as by post-industrial wastelands, artists such as Michael Heizer, Nancy Holt and Robert Smithson moved earth to create colossal primal symbols. Others punctuated the horizon with man-made signposts, such as Christo's Running Fence and Walter de Maria's The Lightning Field. For Richard Long, journeys became works of art while Dennis Oppenheim immersed his entire body in the contours of the land. In this broad survey of Land Art, Brian Wallis discusses the key artists, works and issues that define Land Art historically, as well as its later ramifications.<br><br>This book fully documents the 1960s Land Art movement and surveys examples of Environmental Art to the present day. Earthworks, environments, performances and actions by artists ranging from Ana Mendieta in the 1970s and 80s to Peter Fend in the 1990s are illustrated with breathtaking photographs, sketches and project notes.</p><p>Jeffrey Kastner, based in New York, is a writer on art and culture. Senior Editor of Cabinet magazine, he is a former Senior Editor of ARTnews, and Contributing Editor of Art Monthly. As well as lecturing on art in America and Europe, Kastner has contributed reviews and essays on contemporary art and popular culture for numerous magazines, including Artforum, Art &amp; Design, Flash Art, The Economist and frieze. Brian Wallis is Chief Curator and Director of Exhibitions at the International Center of Photography, New York. As well as curating, he has taught Critical Theory at Yale University and was McCracken Fellow at New York University. Wallis has authored and edited numerous books on contemporary culture, among them Art After Modernism (New Museum/David Godine, 1984), Blasted Allegories (New Museum/MIT Press, 1986) and Constructing Masculinity (Routledge, 1995). In 1996 he curated the exhibition 'Counterculture: Alternative Information from the Underground Press to the Internet' at Exit Art in New York. Wallis was formerly senior editor of Art in America and a curator at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York, where he organized serveral exhibitions including a Hans Haacke retrospective in 1986.&#34;This extraordinary book... In his Survey, Brian Wallis gives a good overview of the art historical context of the early works, demonstrating their genesis in relation to minimalism and the modernist ideologies of critics such as Greenberg and Michael Fried. He also manages to give a sense of the radical ferment of the time: the earliest earthworks were made at the height of the Vietnam War, around the time of the student riots in Paris... What makes the book invaluable is the comprehensiveness of its illustrations and the fascinating collection of documents in its final section. Divided by the colour of their headlines into artist&#39;s statements, critical comment, and writings on the cultural contexts of land and environmental art, these documents vastly expand the sweep of the book. From contemporary reviews and interviews with artists to extracts from historical texts, novels and exhibition catalogues, this section could have stood alone as a source-book and an evocation of the times and thinking behind this art.&#34;-Modern Painters &#34;The inclusiveness of this compendium of sparkling photographs and previously published texts... is practically encyclopaedic.&#34;-College Art Association U.A. &#34;Land and Environmental Art is a wonderfully conceived and lavishly packaged survey of environmental art from the 1960s to the present. It provides a rich array of resources to help readers to understand and appreciate this tradition... Were Land and Environmental Art to end here, it would already be a splendid book, but a third section, titled Documents;, offers some 100 pages of excerpts from a variety of sources, all of which have a bearing on the works presented earlier.

Huge, handsomely designed... The photographs in the book are gorgeous (the opening panorama of De Maria&#39;s The Lightning Field is worth the book&#39;s price alone).&#34;-Azure Magazine &#34;The chief merit of this stout volume is its documentary value. Anyone interested in this sphere of art-making should acquire the book forthwith.&#34;-Burlington Magazine &#34;How, then, will this sumptuous offering from Phaidon be used in Britain? The hope is that it will rapidly take its place as the big book on the subject and gradually inject critical rigour and a sense of history into current British art in and about landscape.

Fred is the police agent assigned to tail and eventually bust him. What Fred doesn�&#x20ac;&#x2122;t know is that Substance D gradually splits the user�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s brain into two distinct, combative entities, and that he is, in fact, in frantic pursuit of himself. <br><br><i>A Scanner Darkly</i> is caustically funny and razor sharp in its depiction of drug-induced paranoia and madness; it�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s an industrial-strength stress test of identity as unnerving as it is riveting. The novel is captured in this brilliant graphic vision, composed entirely of stills from the movie. <br><br>Writer/Director Richard Linklater shot a live-action film, starring Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Woody Harrelson, and Winona Ryder, and then animated over the underlying images. The result is an eerily lifelike, richly detailed animation that translates beautifully to the page.</p><p>Mind- and reality-bending drugs factor again and again in Philip K. Dick's hugely influential SF stories. <i>A Scanner Darkly</i> cuts closest to the bone, drawing on Dick's own experience with illicit chemicals and on his many friends who died from drug abuse. Nevertheless, it's blackly farcical, full of comic-surreal conversations between people whose synapses are partly fried, sudden flights of paranoid logic, and bad trips like the one whose victim spends a subjective eternity having all his sins read to him, in shifts, by compound-eyed aliens. (It takes 11,000 years of this to reach the time when as a boy he discovered masturbation.) The antihero Bob Arctor is forced by his double life into warring double personalities: as futuristic narcotics agent "Fred," face blurred by a high-tech scrambler, he must spy on and entrap suspected drug dealer Bob Arctor. His disintegration under the influence of the insidious Substance D is genuine tragicomedy. For Arctor there's no way off the addict's downward escalator, but what awaits at the bottom is a kind of redemption--there are more wheels within wheels than we suspected, and his life is not entirely wasted. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i>&#x201c;Dick is Thoreau plus the death of the American dream.&#x201d;&#x2014;Roberto Bola�o<br><br>Bob Arctor is a junkie and a drug dealer, both using and selling the mind-altering Substance D. Fred is a law enforcement agent, tasked with bringing Bob down. It sounds like a standard case. The only problem is that Bob and Fred are the same person. Substance D doesn&#x2019;t just alter the mind, it splits it in two, and neither side knows what the other is doing or that it even exists. Now, both sides are growing increasingly paranoid as Bob tries to evade Fred while Fred tries to evade his suspicious bosses.<br> In this award-winning novel, friends can become enemies, good trips can turn terrifying, and cops and criminals are two sides of the same coin. Dick is at turns caustically funny and somberly contemplative, fashioning a novel that is as unnerving as it is enthralling.<br><br>Over a career that spanned three decades, Philip K. Dick (1928&#x2013;1982) wrote 121 short stories and 45 novels, establishing himself as one of the most visionary authors of the twentieth century.

It is democratic, ever-changing and ingenious in its assimilation of other cultures. English runs through the heart of world finance, medicine and the Internet, and it is understood by around two thousand million people across the world. Yet it was very nearly wiped out in its early years. In this book Melvyn Bragg shows us the remarkable story of the English language; from its beginnings as a minor guttural Germanic dialect to its position today as a truly established global language. THE ADVENTURE OF ENGLISH is not only an enthralling story of power, religion and trade, but also the story of people, and how their day-to-day lives shaped and continue to change the extraordinary language that is English.</p><p>Melvyn Bragg has written several works of non-fiction (as well as his bestselling novels) including Speak for England, an oral history of the twentieth century, Rich, a biography of Richard Burton and On Giants&#39; Shoulders, a history of science based on his BBC radio series. He was born in 1939 and educated at Wigton&#39;s Nelson Tomlinson Shool and at Oxford where he read history. He is controller of Arts at LWT and President of the National Campaign for the Arts, and in 1998 he was made a life peer. He lives in London and Cumbria.This compelling and charmingly personal companion to an eight-part television documentary (scheduled for the fall) makes for an idiosyncratic rival to PBS's bestselling blockbuster <i>The Story of English</i>, by Robert McCrum et al<i>.</i> Titling a history of the evolution and expansion of a language an "adventure" presupposes a hero, with such obvious choices as Alfred the Great, for defeating the Danes; Chaucer, for his <i>Canterbury Tales</i>; Shakespeare, for his poetic inventiveness; or Samuel Johnson, for his groundbreaking dictionary. Bragg, a British TV and radio personality and novelist (<i>The Soldier's Return</i>), gives all their contributions their due, but English itself, with its "deep obstinacy" and "astonishing flexibility," emerges as his favorite character. Bragg's enthusiasm for his subject-hero, whether the Old English of <i>Beowulf </i>or the new "Text English" of the Internet, makes up for his shortcomings as a linguist: his sources, unfootnoted, are at times at variance with the OED or Webster's Third. For instance, Bragg furnishes only one putative origin for the disputed "real McCoy." Moreover "candy" does not seem to have Anglo-Indian origins (it's from the Arabic "qandi"), and the first recorded use of "vast" is not from Shakespeare (the OED cites Archbishop Edwin Sandys). Nevertheless, this "biography" succeeds in its broad, sweeping narrative, carrying the reader from the origins of Anglo-Saxon through the Viking and Norman invasions to the consolidation of "British" English and outward to America, Australia, India, the West Indies and beyond. After some 1,500 years, with one billion speakers now worldwide, according to Bragg, the English language has displayed an amazing ability to repair and reinvent itself, as Bragg ably shows. 32 pages of color illus. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

One, a Polish-born woman from Bialystok, where virtually the entire Jewish community would soon be sent to the ghetto and from there to Hitler&#x2019;s concentration camps, was determined not only to live but to live with pride and defiance. The other, a Russian-born intellectual and introvert, would eventually become a high-level censor under Stalin&#x2019;s regime. At war&#x2019;s end, both women found themselves in Moscow, where informers lurked on every corner and anti-Semitism reigned. It was there that Ester and Ruzya would first cross paths, there that they became the closest of friends and learned to trust each other with their lives. <br><br>In this deeply moving family memoir, journalist Masha Gessen tells the story of her two beloved grandmothers: Ester, the quicksilver rebel who continually battled the forces of tyranny; Ruzya, a single mother who joined the Communist Party under duress and made the compromises the regime exacted of all its citizens. Both lost their first loves in the war. Both suffered unhappy unions. Both were gifted linguists who made their living as translators. And both had children&#x2014;Ester a boy, and Ruzya a girl&#x2014;who would grow up, fall in love, and have two children of their own: Masha and her younger brother.<br><br>With grace, candor, and meticulous research, Gessen peels back the layers of secrecy surrounding her grandmothers&#x2019; lives. As she follows them through this remarkable period in history&#x2014;from the Stalin purges to the Holocaust, from the rise of Zionism to the fall of communism&#x2014;she describes how each of her grandmothers, and before them her great-grandfather, tried to navigate a dangerous line between conscience and compromise. <br><br>Ester and Ruzya is a spellbinding work of storytelling, filled with political intrigue and passionate emotion, acts of courage and acts of betrayal. At once an intimate family chronicle and a fascinating historical tale, it interweaves the stories of two women with a brilliant vision of Russian history. The result is a memoir that reads like a novel&#x2014;and an extraordinary testament to the bonds of family and the power of hope, love, and endurance.</p><p>Masha Gessen was born in the U.S.S.R., emigrated to the United States when she was fourteen years old, and later returned to Russia as a foreign correspondent. She makes her permanent home in Moscow with her partner, Svenya, and their two children but is currently living in Boston, where she has a Neiman Fellowship at Harvard.Chapter One<br><br>Like any place that has been lost, Bialystok was heaven on Earth. Or the center of the universe. That, in fact, it was--or at least it was a sort of universal crossroads. It had been ruled by Prussia, Russia, and Poland, and its streets rang with Yiddish, Polish, Hebrew, Belarusian, German, and Russian: this was perhaps why Esperanto was invented there. It was also--no, it was most importantly--a center of Jewish life in Poland between the two world wars, when Poland was the center of Jewish life in Europe. More than half of its one hundred thousand residents were Jewish; and Jews, having lived there for five centuries, dominated the city's business, political, and cultural life. The current crop of Judeophile Polish historians is fond of claiming that Bialystok in the interwar period was spared the ugly anti-Semitic incidents that grew frequent in the rest of Poland, but this is not so. It is nonetheless true that Bialystok had more synagogues per capita than any city in the world, that in addition to Jewish schools and the world's first Jewish ambulance service it had Jewish old-age homes and soup kitchens, an orphanage and various other charities, and that all of this earned it the moniker "The City with the Golden Heart" among European Jewry.<br><br>Bialystok was neither particularly flat nor especially hilly. It had a broad main promenade and a web of crooked cobblestone streets. It had a Jewish quarter that was largely poor, and it had other, more affluent neighborhoods, where the landlords were mixed and the tenants were mostly Jewish. It had ambition. Forty years after the city was destroyed, Jewish survivors living in New York published a memorial book that overflowed with pride in the city's prewar accomplishments: "Bialystok's streets grew more beautiful. . . .Electric cables were laid under the ground, streets were widened, avenues were lined with trees, and a new sewer system was installed. Large new apartment buildings and four-family homes were constructed."<br><br>In one of these four-family homes on Zlota Street lived the Goldbergs, my grandmother Ester's family. The name of their street in Polish and their surname in Yiddish meant "golden," and they might have joked about this without a trace of embarrassment, because they really were one of Bialystok's golden families. Her father, Jakub, was a big man. Physically, he was hulking: nearly two meters tall, and robust to the point of appearing about to burst out of his suits. Politically, he was imposing. A member of the General Zionist organization, he was an activist of European stature, which certainly commanded respect locally. And locally, too, he was active, as a member of the municipal council--the city's main governing body--and, later, of the kehilla, the board elected by the Jewish community. Financially, chutzpah was his main capital. A bank he had inherited from his grandmother went bust in the worldwide economic crash of 1929, but Jakub refused to scale back: the fancy apartment, one of the city's few phone lines, Ester's governess, and the other help--none of this would be given up. "If I die tomorrow, do I want to be remembered as the Goldberg who paid his debts on time?" He apparently preferred to be remembered as the Goldberg who knew how to live well. He would ultimately be remembered as neither, but he was basically right: life would not go on like this much longer, and, anyway, he did not mind the gaggle of creditors following him around. He briefly tried going into business by buying a train car's worth of candles he planned to resell, but the merchandise arrived without wicks. He ultimately found a job selling insurance for a large Italian company, but he never did pay off all his debts. Nor did he buy an insurance policy--a fact his wife discovered when their apartment was robbed while they were away on holiday, and his descendants learned about six decades later, when the company in question began paying on the life insurance policies of Holocaust victims.<br><br>Jakub's wife, Bella, on the other hand, was short, even tiny, and held to an entirely different set of political beliefs. She was a member of the Bund, the Jewish workers' party. The wife of one of Bialystok's most prominent Zionists worked as, of all things, a Polish teacher at a Yiddish school. That is, while her husband devoted much of his life to promoting the study of Hebrew for the Jews' eventual return to Palestine, Bella earned her daily bread by helping Jewish children become that much more assimilated by learning the Polish language. But then, her independence did him proud, for she was a university graduate--an anomaly among Polish women at the time, especially Polish Jewish women, especially women from Chasidic families. Yes, they were both from a Chasidic family--they were cousins--and they were both atheists.<br><br>Those are the facts, as best they can be established. What could they mean? Perhaps that the Goldbergs formed that rare happy union of two people who continue to grow, independently, in more or less the same direction, conquering the world together. Raised strictly Orthodox, together they gradually mapped their path away from religion until one day Jakub shaved off his beard and exchanged the wide-brimmed fur-trimmed hat and long coat of a Chasid for a generic European suit.<br><br>Or they may have lived the uneasy union of two people who, while each is driven to act on his convictions, view the world in fundamentally different ways. As a Zionist, Jakub was convinced the Jews belonged in Palestine. Bella, a Bundist, would have subscribed to a different utopian vision, that of Jewish autonomy within Eastern Europe. She was a socialist; he was a banker. He belonged to a party that aimed to establish Jewish national unity as a far more important factor than class; her party opposed any political initiatives that were based solely on the Jewish issue. The argument between their two parties was constantly fought on the floor of the municipal council. On election day Jakub and Bella walked the streets of Bialystok with their respective placards, and he denied her his customary courtesy of walking on the pavement while she walked on the sidewalk (to lessen the nearly two-foot difference in their height).<br><br>History, in its way, has since settled their argument. The Zionists--that is, those of them who had the will, money, and luck to move to Palestine before World War II--survived. The assimilationists, or, as the Bundists were known, the "localists," died where they lived. But then, murder, even systematic and ideologically driven murder, is a function of circumstance more than anything else. Witness the Goldberg case. He was killed; she survived.<br><br>In the years leading up to his death and her unwitting escape, the arguments may or may not have subsided, but they did reach agreement on one thing. Aside from matters of politics and matters of religion, they lived a single joint project: their daughter, Ester, who was born in 1923 and grew up, as only a child of total love and devotion can, knowing that she was the smartest, most beautiful, and luckiest girl, who happened to live in the center of the universe.<br>May 28, 1936<br>This is easily the best day of the year. For the holiday of Shavuot, the Bialystok Hebrew Gymnasium suspends classes and marches its entire student population of several hundred from its imposing brick headquarters on Sienkiewicz Street, down Lipowa, the main street--decorated in lavish green for the holiday--through the park and past the staring occupants of the Forty-first Infantry Division barracks, and into Pietrasze Forest for an entire day of campfires, singing, and eating cheese, honey, and triangular kreplachs. The small kids--the three- to-five-year-olds--are brought along for their traditional introduction to Jewish schooling, and they run around sticky with the honey meant to sweeten the taste of scholarship. The older kids--Ester is thirteen, which places her in the dignified middle of the gymnasium's age spectrum--throw themselves into the forest silliness, running around and screaming, only to slow down after a bit for some earnest confessions out of earshot of all but a few close confidantes and for the occasional argument on the political (read: Zionist) issue of the day.<br><br>It is still a couple of hours till sundown but the air is starting to cool and some of the children are already casting about for their things when Ester sees a girl from one of the upper classes running awkwardly from the edge of the forest. She is a big girl, with strong legs and thick arms and a mane of light brown hair that is now undone, flying away from her face in a way that somehow, to Ester, signals fear. She stops when she reaches a smoldering campfire and, standing firmly now, starts screaming, her words apparent nonsense: "We are surrounded!" It takes a few minutes for the mood to shift and her words to begin making sense. The soldiers from the Forty-first Infantry Division have encircled this part of the forest and are swearing not to allow any of the "little kikes" out. The two boys with whom Hanna--this is the messenger's name--tried to leave the party have been so severely beaten they are still trying to make their way back here.<br><br>The rest of the day leaves no room to be a thirteen-year-old. The teachers and some of the upperclassmen huddle, while the other older students herd the small kids into a clearing and proceed to count them obsessively, every two or three minutes. A boy from the graduating class is dispatched to try to sneak out to alert the authorities. The authorities are personified this time by Jakub Goldberg, who, being an atheist, is ignoring the holiday and working in his office in the municipal council. For the following five hours he feels very much like his thirteen-year-old daughter: his first, overconfident call to the police elicits a satisfied chuckle on the other end of the line. His calls to leaders of the various Jewish organizations succeed only in raising the level of hysteria.

Mount Misery is a prestigious facility set in the rolling green hills of New England, its country club atmosphere maintained by generous corporate contributions. Dr. Roy Basch (hero of The House of God) is lucky enough to train there *only to discover doctors caught up in the circus of competing psychiatric theories, and patients who are often there for one main reason: they've got good insurance.<br>From the Laws of Mount Misery:<br><br>Your colleagues will hurt you more than your patients.<br><br>On rounds at Mount Misery, it's not always easy for Basch to tell the patients from the doctors: Errol Cabot, the drug cowboy whose practice provides him with guinea pigs for his imaginative prescription cocktails . . . Blair Heiler, the world expert on borderlines (a diagnosis that applies to just about everybody) . . . A. K. Lowell, n�e Aliyah K. Lowenschteiner, whose Freudian analytic technique is so razor sharp it prohibits her from actually speaking to patients . . . And Schlomo Dove, the loony, outlandish shrink accused of having sex with a beautiful, well-to-do female patient.<br>From the Laws of Mount Misery:<br><br>Psychiatrists specialize in their defects. <br><br>For Basch the practice of psychiatry soon becomes a nightmare in which psychiatrists compete with one another to find the best ways to reduce human beings to blubbering drug-addled pods, or incite them to an extreme where excessive rage is the only rational response, or tie them up in Freudian knots. And all the while, the doctors seem less interested in their patients' mental health than in a host of other things *managed care insurance money, drug company research grants and kickbacks, and their own professional advancement.<br>From the Laws of Mount Misery:<br><br>In psychiatry, first comes treatment, then comes diagnosis.<br><br>What The House of God did for doctoring the body, Mount Misery does for doctoring the mind. A practicing psychiatrist, Samuel Shem brings vivid authenticity and extraordinary storytelling gifts to this long-awaited sequel, to create a novel that is laugh-out-loud hilarious, terrifying, and provocative. Filled with biting irony and a wonderful sense of the absurd, Mount Misery tells you everything you'll never learn in therapy. And it's a hell of a lot funnier.</p><p>Anyone who has read Samuel Shem's previous novel, <i>The House of God</i>, will be familiar with Dr. Roy Basch, the protagonist of <i>Mount Misery</i>. When last seen, Dr. Basch was completing a grueling residency; <i>Mount Misery</i> finds him beginning his psychiatric training at an upscale New England mental hospital. His introduction to the myriad forms of therapy available today--everything from Freudian psychoanalysis to psychopharmacology--provides Mr. Shem with plenty of blackly humorous grist for his mill. In this hospital, apparently, you need a score card to tell the doctors from the patients. <p> Shem (the pseudonym of psychiatrist and playwright Dr. Stephen Bergman) delights in broad parody. He creates, for example, characters such as Dr. Heiler who gives lectures entitled "Borderline Germans and German Borderlines," or Dr. A. K. Lowell, whose devotion to Freudian analysis is so extreme that she refuses to speak to patients at all. Though the humor can be clumsy at times, Shem makes some serious points about the perils of psychotherapy in which the therapist is not above reproach.</p>"MOUNT MISERY is outrageously funny, a sage and important novel by a healer and a Shakespearean." <br>--The Boston Globe <br> <br>"AN ENGROSSING READ . . .

Her employer takes inappropriate liberties, and as Verna matures, it seems as if each man she meets is worse than the last. Through sheer force of will and a few chance encounters, she manages to teach herself to read and becomes a nurse. But Verna&#x2019;s new life falls to pieces when she is arrested for assisting a black doctor with "illegal surgeries." As the media firestorm rages, Verna reflects on her life while awaiting trial. <br><br>Based on the life of the author&#x2019;s own grandmother and written after almost three hundred interviews with those involved in the real-life scandal, <i>The Blue Orchard </i>is as elegant and moving as it is exact and convincing. It is a dazzling portrayal of the changes America underwent in the first fifty years of the twentieth century. Readers will be swept into a time period that in many ways mirrors our own. Verna Krone&#x2019;s story is ultimately a story of the indomitable nature of the human spirit&#x2014;and a reminder that determination and self-education can defy the deforming pressures that keep women and other disenfranchised groups down.</p><p>Jackson Taylor is the Associate Director of The New School's Graduate Writing Program, which he helped launch, and where he teaches.

In town, at the Market, I notice people finger-pointing and whispering, and upon quick return to my car on Broad Street, I see one enterprising soul has broken an egg on the windshield. Now I&#x2019;m reluctant to even go downtown. Over the years I&#x2019;ve always drawn a bit of attention, the oddball stare or squinting curiosity; there&#x2019;s speculation, a certain notice of my clothes, whispered gossip. They might even know I&#x2019;m a nurse.<br> <br>People who don&#x2019;t know Dr. Crampton might imagine him as some kind of back-alley butcher in a bad part of town, slicing open unfortunate women lying naked under a bare lightbulb. The truth, however, is that Dr. Crampton has for over half a century been our city&#x2019;s leading Negro citizen. His widely respected medical practice opened in 1904, and prior to our arrest, no lawman would have dared tamper with him, for he is also a full-fledged member of a political machine as proudly crooked as any in the nation. He is the state&#x2019;s deputy secretary of health and a vice-chairman of the Republican Party.<br> <br>Yes, Dr. Crampton has always played his cards right, moving about town in king-sized late-model Lincolns, chauffeured by men who are sometimes as shockingly white as the gloves they wear. I&#x2019;ve witnessed firsthand how Dr. Crampton throws money around; he greases big wheels, plays Daddy Benefactor, buys flowers, medicine, mortgages, baby carriages, and Negro votes, which for decades have been delivered to his Republican friends.<br> <br>Not only is Dr. Crampton the undisputed leader of the Seventh Ward, which is colored, but in 1919 he founded the Negro YMCA, and he also sits on the governing boards of any number of banks, churches, medical groups, and charities. For me, it&#x2019;s been an honor to work for this astonishing man, to attend the many tributes and testimonial dinners held on his behalf, where citations from governors and senators are bestowed. In fact, his commanding presence is such a certainty of life in our city that on the morning of the 14th of November the whole town gasps when we are arrested.<br> <br>The police ransack his well-furnished yellow townhouse, root out the ground floor&#x2019;s medical offices, then climb upstairs to his private quarters, where his closets are emptied, his dresser drawers dumped, his fine wardrobe tangled: silk ties, shoes, shirts, suspenders, and spats. In every room hand-knotted Persian rugs are heaved up and piled into mountains, leather-bound books are swept from mahogany shelving, and his collection of French portraits and American landscapes are pulled from the walls and stacked like firewood. Even the furnace in his basement and the meat in his kitchen freezer are examined.<br> <br>A short time later the police proceed uptown to my own house at 2311 North Third Street. In their report they describe it as a three-story, red-brick dwelling with pillared porch and mansard roof. Recently our city&#x2019;s ill-conceived Capitol extension project has caused many great houses in Harrisburg to decline, as angry displaced Negroes without the means to make repairs move farther uptown with every passing month. But everyone knows that if you live above MacClay Street, as I do, the neighborhood is unlikely to change. It will remain elegant, wealthy, and white. The police rarely have business here.<br> <br>Dewey, my husband, answers the knock. The tough voices at the door alert me.<br> <br>Trouble.<br> <br>I quickly lie down on one of the beds in the dining room, pull a cover up over my clothes, and pretend to be ill.<br> <br>The men enter. I can see the cops silently glance at each other as they count the number of beds in the downstairs rooms.<br> <br>&#x201c;You Verna Krone?&#x201d;<br> <br>I nod.<br> <br>&#x201c;You work for Doctor Crampton?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a licensed nurse,&#x201d; I answer.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re under arrest for illegal surgery.&#x201d;<br> <br>I lie back as if too sick to move and let them search the house. Dewey follows them around like a bellhop waiting for a tip.<br> <br>Left alone for a moment, my wits gather and a guise of tough calm overtakes me. I can&#x2019;t believe they&#x2019;ve stated the crime so obliquely, but of course they can&#x2019;t make an arrest without making some kind of charge. &#x201c;Relax,&#x201d; I whisper to myself. &#x201c;Relax into the conflict.&#x201d; Isn&#x2019;t that what Dr. Crampton would do? From the hallway closet upstairs, one of them removes enamel basins&#x2014;a full dozen&#x2014;several cartons of sanitary napkins, and some freshly sterilized syringes. It all gets lugged downstairs. &#x201c;Why all the Kotex?&#x201d; the fat one asks.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is there a law against menstruation?&#x201d;<br> <br>They cringe. Female stuff. My belligerence irritates them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why all these syringes?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a nurse. I make house calls,&#x201d; I say, sounding plenty peeved to be answering such questions. Meanwhile I&#x2019;m relieved to see they&#x2019;ve found nothing of significance. The joke&#x2019;s on them. A day earlier and the house would have been full of women.<br> <br>They want to take me downtown, but I tell them I am too sick to travel. They&#x2019;re puzzled, demand to know what ails me.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a serious condition with my vertebrae,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;My orthopedist has prescribed total bed rest. Take me downtown and you&#x2019;ll cause permanent injury to my spine.&#x201d;<br> <br>They don&#x2019;t like it but are afraid to call my bluff.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got orders,&#x201d; the taller one stammers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;ll contend with Harvey Taylor if you try to move me,&#x201d; I say, making tough, like I could wrestle and hog-tie both of them.<br> <br>The detectives are dumbfounded. Harvey Taylor runs the state and these boys know it. For the time being my lie works. They exit.<br> <br>The night drags. I lie awake and speculate, afraid to use the phone, afraid to leave the house, afraid to fear the worst. Early the next morning the detectives are back and, spine or no spine, insist I accompany them to the courthouse, where Dr. Crampton has been sitting up all night waiting to see the judge. My condition requires me to put on quite an act of pain, suffering into my black cashmere coat and fox-fur collar, hobbling out to the car, wincing at every step. It&#x2019;s all for show, but if I keep it up, maybe it will allow me to return home and not be placed in a holding cell.<br> <br>When I enter the courthouse, Dr. Crampton lifts his gaze to look at me. His lips press together in the faintest recognition. I nod, almost imperceptibly, pretend to barely know him. Our courthouse isn&#x2019;t segregated, but on that day it might as well be, for I take a seat on the far side of the waiting room, as far away from Dr. Crampton as possible.<br> <br>If I had it to live over again, I&#x2019;d do it differently. I&#x2019;d find my courage, sit beside him, renounce the detachment, wide as an ocean, that pulls me from the dear man who is losing everything. But on that day&#x2014;after being arrested&#x2014;I will not stir. I will not admit to feeling anything for him: no good can come of it.<br> <br>Our arrest is teaching me the limits of my daring. Even now, it surprises me how before that day I never really accepted that Dr. Crampton was colored. I preferred to view him as the sole member of a separate species, unique, unbound by the conventions and problems of ordinary Negroes. But of course he&#x2019;s not white either, and now trouble shows his skin growing ever darker and affirms the folly of my self-serving vision. Dr. Crampton is being stripped of his special privilege, and it&#x2019;s time to recognize that he is a Negro, and I am white.<br> <br>Till the day I die, I will regret that day, and how the safety of my own race seduces me to disengage from his, to suddenly follow previously ignored codes. The change is subtle, almost unnoticeable; only he can detect it. The notice gets chiseled on his heart: <i>Let your ship of misery pull away, I am staying ashore</i>.<br> <br>In America we are born knowing a Negro can pull a white woman down simply by association. And a Negro on his way down? Well, perish the thought.<br> <br>It isn&#x2019;t done. It isn&#x2019;t done. It isn&#x2019;t done by me.<br> <br>Affections for a Negro man that run as deep as mine are not appropriate. They menace. Imagine what can come of them. Probably a majority of people believe our relationship is or was romantic or sexual. They assume he lusts for me and I for him. They wink at the notion of a professional partnership, a collegial cooperation between a Negro man and a white woman.<br> <br>By the time we see the judge, it&#x2019;s late in the day and I&#x2019;ve been named as codefendant. My brain slows like cold molasses, stuck with one thought: Are we in for a soft rap on the knuckles or a real prison sentence? No one seems to know.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not guilty,&#x201d; I say, following Crampton&#x2019;s lead, trying to sound confident. Once the bail money has been posted, we are free to go. Latenight phone calls go out to Dr. Crampton&#x2019;s friends, but now, suddenly, few can afford to take his call. The situation is too dangerous.<br> <br>Pending the trial&#x2019;s outcome, and because of the unpleasant attention I drew at the Broad Street Market, I&#x2019;ve retreated here to the farm, where I&#x2019;ll stay until all this has been decided. It&#x2019;s a fruit farm, one hundred acres, less than an hour north of Harrisburg, with a breezeway connecting the main house to a small stone summer kitchen. Inside is a big black range, where in warm weather I cook and do the canning&#x2014;and at any time of year come to sit when I need to brood on something.<br> <br>Crampton has always warned me not to keep records and maybe he&#x2019;s right. Maybe I should&#x2019;ve just written our business down in the dirt and let the rain settle it. But now, after the arrest, I&#x2019;m glad a record exists, hidden in the summerhouse under the walnut dry sink, a dishwashing stand no longer used in this day and age. Here two gallon jugs of vinegar rest on a slab of soapstone, and when all that&#x2019;s taken out, two boards can be lifted to reveal a false bottom.<br> <br>The ledger stored there measures five by seven inches and sits more than an inch thick. The cover is worn and battered from fifteen years of duty. Moisture and passing years have warped the paper, but each page lists the names of nine patients, complete with addresses and phone numbers&#x2014;front and back make eighteen&#x2014;the entire book holding more than five thousand names. Each woman was also required to list a person we could contact in case of an emergency. When you add those names in, ten thousand people are listed. The book is a map not just of Harrisburg but the entire state: Main Line mansions near Philadelphia, shacks in the coal regions up north, missions on skid rows everywhere. Sometimes, in the margins, I note who referred a particular girl, inking in senators, congressmen, and clergy. Harrisburg is only ninety miles from Washington, D.C., and a handful of referrals have even come from White House administrators working under Roosevelt, Truman, and most recently Eisenhower. Can anyone on this list get our case thrown out of court?<br> <br>Some people live without compasses, and for years I&#x2019;ve counted myself among them, roaming whatever moral direction I pleased, changing course if and only when it suited me. But the arrest brings uncertainty. On the one hand, I&#x2019;ve always believed discretion for our patients to be sacred. On the other, I didn&#x2019;t expect to retire so soon. Why should we take the fall when ten thousand others are complicit? The ledger is a dangerous double-edged weapon. It can be guided to favor our case or turned to give evidence against us.<br> <br>I leaf through the book and remember the faces, the horrible stories: incest, beatings, rape&#x2014;and ordinary housewives who just didn&#x2019;t want another baby. Every case was different: girls under twenty, wide-eyed and frightened, women over forty, tired and drawn, career girls, sensible and sure, tough girls who often cried more than the others, bad girls who were foulmouthed and mean, the sick, the abused, the adulterous, the jilted, the lovelorn, the mentally infirm, and of course the damned. We saw every religion, every educational background, and every size of bank account. Some of the women hemorrhaged, and there was that lone woman from Lewiston, an attractive bookkeeper, the only patient in fifteen years we ever lost. She bled to death.<br> <br>Some of the women befriended me and over passing time still send me Christmas cards, grateful to have been in the hands of a good doctor and not left to one of the butchers. Other women came and went and are long forgotten. Our practice was the place where women&#x2019;s terrors intersected women&#x2019;s dreams. And would I have cared about any of it if I hadn&#x2019;t also been making piles of money?<br> <br>I&#x2019;m forty-four years old, and suddenly I see how I&#x2019;ve blinded myself to the many small, regrettable qualities I possess&#x2014;pride and greed foremost among them. Over the years a series of tiny transgressions has led to even greater ones, and now I&#x2019;m left to weigh the stone I carry around where my heart used to be.<br> <br>I&#x2019;ve never been good at keeping a diary. Looking back, the age and experience I&#x2019;ve acquired seem to heighten my naivet� and ignorance. I read my old words and feel stupid all over again, and like many people who keep records, I&#x2019;ve grown obsessed with hiding this one, always fearing the secret reader who will stumble across it and snoop on me. Yet now I realize I&#x2019;ve always written with just that person in mind. Many times I&#x2019;ve thought of tearing up the book or placing it in the fire, but I&#x2019;ve held on. I stare at it and somehow its pages lay my life bare. Herein I see myself as others might.<br> <br>Still, this ledger cannot replace what I remember, for now I see that what one doesn&#x2019;t write is often more important than what gets written. Perhaps none of this matters to anyone but me, but I am someone, and suddenly it seems important not to forget that lonely, dirt-poor girl I once was&#x2014;if only to know how I ended up here, to know how I became Verna Krone.</p><h2>The Day It Snowed Tortillas / El Dia Que Nevaron Tortillas, Folktales told in Spanish and English</h2><p><p>Kids of all ages are always asking Joe Hayes, "How can it snow tortillas?" Well, now they&#x2019;ll know where to find the answer&#x2014;at long last, Joe&#x2019;s signature book <i>The Day It Snowed Tortillas </i>is appearing in this new bilingual edition. <i>Bloomsbury Review </i>listed the original English-only edition as one of their fifteen all-time favorite children&#x2019;s books. Our bilingual edition has all the original stories as they have evolved in the last twenty years of Joe&#x2019;s storytelling. It also has new illustrations by award-winning artist Antonio Castro. Storytellers have been telling these stories in the villages of New Mexico since the Spanish first came to the New World over four hundred years ago, but Joe always adds his own nuances for modern audiences. The tales are full of magic and fun. In the title story, for instance, a very clever woman saves her silly husband from a band of robbers. She makes the old man believe it snowed tortillas during the night! In another story, a young boy gladly gives up all of his wages for good advice. His parents think he is a fool, but the good advice leads to wealth and a royal marriage. The enchantment continues in story after story&#x2014;a clever thief tricks a king for his kingdom and a prince finds his beloved in a house full of wicked step-sisters. And of course, we listen again to the ancient tale of the weeping woman, La Llorona, who still searches for her drowned children along the riverbanks. </p><p>El <i>Bloomsbury Review</i> nombr� la edici�n original de este libro entre sus 15 libros favoritos de todos los tiempos.

Quartet and The Underworld USA Trilogy, James Ellroy, presents another literary noir masterpiece of historical paranoia</b>.<br><br>In this savagely audacious novel, James Ellroy<i> </i>plants a pipe bomb under the America in the 1960s, lights the fuse, and watches the shrapnel fly. On November 22, 1963 three men converge in Dallas. Their job: to clean up the JFK hit&#x2019;s loose ends and inconvenient witnesses. They are Wayne Tedrow, Jr., a Las Vegas cop with family ties to the lunatic right; Ward J. Littell, a defrocked FBI man turned underworld mouthpiece; and Pete Bondurant, a dope-runner and hit-man who serves as the mob&#x2019;s emissary to the anti-Castro underground.<br><br>It goes bad from there. For the next five years these night-riders run a whirlwind of plots and counter-plots: Howard Hughes&#x2019;s takeover of Vegas, J. Edgar Hoover&#x2019;s war against the civil rights movement, the heroin trade in Vietnam, and the murders of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Bobby Kennedy. Wilder than <i>L. A. Confidential, </i>more devastating than <i>American Tabloid, </i><b>The Cold Six Thousand </b>establishes Ellroy as one of our most fearless novelists.</p><p>With its hypnotic, staccato rhythms, and words jostling, bumping, marching forward with edgy intensity (like lemmings heading toward a cliff of their own devising), <i>The Cold Six Thousand</i> feels as if it's being narrated by a hopped-up Dr. Seuss who's hungrier for violence than for green eggs and ham. In spinning the threads of post-JFK-assassination cultural chaos, James Ellroy's whirlwind riff on the 1960s takes nothing for granted, except that absolute power corrupts absolutely. <p> Hurtling from Las Vegas to Vietnam to Cuba to Memphis and back again (and all points in between), from Dealey Plaza to opium fields to smoke-filled back rooms where the mob holds sway, the novel traces the strands of complicity, greed, and fear that connect three men to a legion of supporting characters: Ward Littell, a former Feeb whose current allegiance to the mob and to Howard Hughes can't mask his admiration for the Kennedy brothers and Martin Luther King; Pete Bondurant, a hit man and fervent anti-Communist who splits his time between Vegas casinos and CIA-sponsored heroin labs in Saigon; and Wayne Tedrow Jr., a young Vegas cop who's sent to Dallas in late November 1963 to snuff a black pimp, and who is fighting a losing battle against his predilection for violence: "Junior was a hider. Junior was a watcher. Junior lit flames. Junior torched. Junior lived in his head." </p><p> And behind these three, J. Edgar Hoover is the master puppeteer, pulling strings with visionary zeal and resolute pragmatism, the still point around whom the novel roils and tumbles. At once evil and comic, Hoover predicts that LBJ "will deplete his prestige on the home front and recoup it in Vietnam. History will judge him as a tall man with big ears who needed wretched people to love him," and feels that Cuba "appeals to hotheads and the morally impaired. It's the cuisine and the sex. Plantains and women who have intercourse with donkeys."</p><p> The Seussian comparison isn't that far-fetched: Ellroy's novel, like the children's books (and like the very decade it limns), is flexible, spontaneous, and unabashedly off-kilter. Weighing in at a hefty 700 pages, <i>The Cold Six Thousand</i> is a trifle bloated by the excesses of its narrative form. But what glorious excess it is, as Ellroy continues to illuminate the twin impulses toward idealism and corruption that frame American popular and political culture. He deftly puts unforgettable faces and voices to the murkiest of conspiracy theories, and simultaneously mocks our eager assumption that such knowledge will make a difference. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>In this savagely audacious novel, James Ellroy" plants a pipe bomb under the America in the 1960s, lights the fuse, and watches the shrapnel fly.

But there are forces that can and do reverse it. They are not spectators, or critics, or occasional demonstrators. They are groups of citizens, encouraged and trained to take power with dignity and creativity and unrelenting determination, and to make it work for them, day by day, month by month, and year to year. <br><br> For more than twenty-five years, Michael Gecan has been a professional organizer with Industrial Areas Foundation, which has trained thousands of little-known community groups from Brownsville, Texas, to Brownsville, Brooklyn. Having grown up witnessing at close range the destructive effects of political patronage on powerless, disenfranchised Chicago communities, Gecan knows from experience that strong relationships in the public sphere and sustained and disciplined organizing can spark the public and private alchemy necessary to achieve sidewalks, parks, schools, housing--and the collective renewal that results. <br><br> Full of good advice and entertaining accounts of success, <i>Going Public</i> is the story of those who, says Gecan, &#x201c;succeed in unexpected ways and in unexpected places.&#x201d;</p><p>Michael Gecan is a community organizer and has worked for the Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF) in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Baltimore for more than thirty-five years.

David's word with Sibyl's blending, Heaven and earth in ashes ending. We open with the Dies Irae, because it applies to the Three Days of Darkness. Pope Saint Gregory the Great says in his Regula Pastoralis: &#x201c;Let them be told how the Prophet Sophonias holds out over them the stroke of divine reproof, when he says: 'Behold, the day of the Lord is coming, great and horrible . . . . That day is a day of wrath, a day of darkness and obscurity, a day of clouds and whirlwinds, a day of the trumpet and alarm against all the fenced cities and against all the high corners.'&#x201d; 1 Note this verse inspired the Dies Irae. The purpose of this book is to provide all of the prophecies that relate to the Three Days of Darkness. These are placed in a chronological order similar to that employed by Father Culleton is his two books, Antichrist and The Prophets and Our Times. They are provided without comment so that you can study the prophecies themselves. Some of the prophecies may appear out of place, but they will make sense as you move forward. It is strongly recommended that you make notes as you proceed forward with this book. In this way you can sort things out for yourself. Padre Pio predicted the Three Days of Darkness. So does Sacred Scripture, which calls it the Day of the Lord. Even Jesus Himself referred to the Three Days of Darkness in the Gospels.

Seizing on the striking similarities between the religious vision of this &#x201c;heretic&#x201d; pharaoh and the teachings of Moses, Sigmund Freud was the first to argue that Moses was in fact an Egyptian. Now Ahmed Osman, using recent archaeological discoveries and historical documents, contends that Akhenaten and Moses were one and the same man. <br> <br>In a stunning retelling of the Exodus story, Osman details the events of Moses/Akhenaten's life: how he was brought up by Israelite relatives, ruled Egypt for seventeen years, angered many of his subjects by replacing the traditional Egyptian pantheon with worship of the Aten, and was forced to abdicate the throne. Retreating to the Sinai with his Egyptian and Israelite supporters, he died out of the sight of his followers, presumably at the hands of Seti I, after an unsuccessful attempt to regain his throne. <br> <br>Osman reveals the Egyptian components in the monotheism preached by Moses as well as his use of Egyptian royal ritual and Egyptian religious expression.

Essential reading for all Bible historians.&#x201d; <br>--Andrew Collins, author of <em>From the Ashes of Angels</em> and <em>Gateway to Atlantis</em> <br> <br>During his reign, the Pharaoh Akhenaten was able to abolish the complex pantheon of the ancient Egyptian religion and replace it with a single god, Aten, who had no image or form. Seizing on the striking similarities between the religious vision of this &#x201c;heretic&#x201d; pharaoh and the teachings of Moses, Sigmund Freud was the first to argue that Moses was in fact an Egyptian. Now Ahmed Osman, using recent archaeological discoveries and historical documents, contends that Akhenaten and Moses were one and the same man. <br> <br>In a reinterpretation of the Exodus story, Osman details the events of Moses/Akhenaten's life: how he was brought up by Israelite relatives, ruled Egypt for seventeen years, angered many of his subjects by replacing the traditional Egyptian pantheon with monotheism, and was forced to abdicate the throne. Retreating to the Sinai with his Egyptian and Israelite supporters, he died out of the sight of his followers, presumably at the hands of Seti I, after an unsuccessful attempt to regain his throne. <br> <br>Osman reveals the Egyptian components in the monotheism preached by Moses as well as his use of the Egyptian royal ritual and Egyptian religious expression. He shows that even the Ten Commandments reveal the direct influence of Spell 125 in the Egyptian Book of the Dead. <em>Moses and Akhenaten</em> provides a radical challenge to long-standing beliefs concerning the origin of Semitic religion and the puzzle of Akhenaten's deviation from ancient Egyptian tradition. In fact, if Osman's contentions are correct, many of the major Old Testament figures are of Egyptian origin. <br> <br>AHMED OSMAN was born in Cairo in 1934, where he studied law. He is also the author of <em>Stranger in the Valley of Kings, Out of Egypt</em>, and <em>The House of the Messiah</em>.

Although lecture can be engaging and even useful, lecture alone cannot give kids real opportunities to learn, retain, and transfer the disciplinary ideas, skills, and practices we're trying to teach. </p> <p> Cris Tovani and Elizabeth Moje help us translate the time spent lecturing into powerful learning experiences where students interact and inquire into topics that matter. Their research-based alternatives help you create the conditions for engaging, relevant work that's inherently interesting and sparks critical thinking. </p> <p> Elizabeth Moje helps us understand the latest research on how people learn, and shows powerful evidence that teachers can increase student learning with more purposeful student participation. Veteran teacher and instructional coach Cris Tovani provides a practical model for instruction that's backed by the current research and puts student engagement at the center of your teaching. Her examples of problem-based learning activities include connections to national standards and topics that matter outside the classroom walls. Together, Elizabeth and Cris make a convincing argument that when we minimize teaching-as-telling and transition to planning for kids to do the work, student engagement soars-and so does learning. <br> <br> </p></p><p><p>Recipient of ILA's Adolescent Literacy Thought Leader Award in 2017, Cris Tovani is a veteran teacher, staff developer, and nationally known consultant on issues of reading, content comprehension and assessment in secondary classrooms.

However, the Nazi conquest of the Low Countries puts an end to that, and he is asked by friends to take their two children back to England. Crossing France with his young charges seems simple enough at first&#x2014;until the Germans invade, rendering them fugitives. As Howard struggles to sneak across France, he picks up several more helpless children of various nationalities. They walk for miles in an endless river of refugees, strafed by German planes and hiding in barns at night. By the time Howard and his flock of little ones reach the Channel, his plan of escaping on a fishing boat has become utterly impossible, and in their final confrontation with the invaders, all their lives are at stake.</p><p>7 1.5-hour cassettes<b>Nevil Shute Norway</b> was born in 1899 in Ealing, London.

She is a slave. It&#39;s dark in the morning when Ella May heads to the fields to pick cotton. And it&#39;s sunset when she comes home. But her day isn&#39;t done, not yet. Ella May still has important work to do. She&#39;s got to listen. Each night Ella May and her friends secretly listen outside the windows of their master&#39;s house. The children listen in the hopes of gleaning information about their fates and those of their loved ones. Who will be sold? Who will stay?

And when the promise of freedom appears on the horizon, the children are the first to hear it.

Pike tells the colorful story of logging and log-driving in New England.</strong></p> The New England loggers and river drivers were a unique breed of men. Working with their axes and peaveys through Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, they contributed mightily to the development of the United States. The daily life of the loggers was hard &#x2015; working in deep icy water fourteen hours a day, sleeping in wet blankets, eating coarse food, and constantly risking their lives. Their pay was very low, yet they were proud to call themselves loggers. When they came out of the woods after the spring drives, they ebulliently spent their pay carousing in the staid New England towns. Robert E. Pike, who as a youth worked in the woods and on the rivers, writes affectionately and knowingly, with humorous anecdotes, of every detail of lumbering. He describes the daily life of the logging camps, giving a picture of the different specialist jobs: the camp boss, the choppers, the sawyers and filers, the scaler, the teamsters, the river men, the railroaders, and the lumber kings. His descriptions bring the reader vividly into the woods, smelling the tangy, newly cut timber, hearing the boom of the falling trees. "The author's lively prose matches the temper of his subject. . . . This is basic history, geography, psychology, economics, and folklore all rolled into one top-quality volume." &#x2015; R. S.

After five years of rejection and one complete revision, Heller's first book,&nbsp;<i>Chickens Aren't the Only Ones</i>, about egg-laying animals, was published in 1981. It was so successful that the sequel, and second book to be published,&nbsp;<i>Animals Born Alive And Well</i>&nbsp;(1982), about mammals, quickly followed. In 1983 and 1984, her third and fourth titles,&nbsp;<i>The Reason For A Flower</i>&nbsp;(about plants that have seeds and flowers) and&nbsp;<i>Plants That Never Ever Bloom</i>&nbsp;(about plants that do not) were published.<br><br>She then began work on a collection of six books, the&nbsp;<i>How To Hide</i>&nbsp;series on camouflage and the magic of this phenomenon in nature, which covered the entire animal kingdom -- insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and sea creatures. The next collection of books became a five-volume series on parts of speech:&nbsp;<i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns; Kites Sail High: A Book About Verbs; Many Luscious Lollipops: A Book About Adjectives; Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Up, Up and Away: A Book About Adverbs</i>. She also wrote and illustrated the unique and fascinating book&nbsp;<i>Color</i>, a charming and instructive guide to how art goes through the four color printing process.<br><br>Among the notable people who have had an influence on Heller's writing have been: Ogden Nash, Gilbert and Sullivan, Edward Lear, Hilaire Belloc, and Dr. Seuss. Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."</p><h2>The I Heart Naptime Cookbook: More Than 100 Easy &amp; Delicious Recipes to Make in Less Than One Hour</h2><p><b>More than 100 inspiring recipes and crafts to cook, bake, and create during that precious hour known as naptime.</b><br>Every parent knows how magical naptime is-that blissful hour when the house is quiet and you actually have a few moments to yourself.

His judgments, according to Don Carson, are always "sane, evenhanded, and judicious." Even while unpacking exegetical details, Peterson constantly scans the horizon, keeping the larger picture in mind. With its solid exegesis, astute theological analysis, and practical contemporary application, Peterson's&nbsp;<i>Acts of the Apostles</i>&nbsp;is a commentary that preachers, teachers, and students everywhere will want and need.</p><p>Principal of Oak Hill Theological College in London,England.<b>Craig S. Keener</b><br> &#x2014; Palmer Theological Seminary<br> "David Peterson interacts with Acts scholarship fairly and in an up-to-date way; his literary and historical conclusions are well informed and sound. His introduction airs issues thoroughly, yet the entire work is easy to follow. Peterson consistently engages the cohesive, larger picture and the theological message of the book."<br><br><b>I. Howard Marshall</b><br> &#x2014; University of Aberdeen<br> "Here in one convenient volume is the basic introductory information and verse-by-verse exegesis that New Testament students and preachers need in order to understand the second part of Luke's account of Christian beginnings. This commentary is noteworthy for its incorporation of a full essay on the theology of Acts and its careful attention to theological issues in the course of the exposition; at the same time it does not neglect historical and literary matters. I warmly commend this useful tool for study."</p><h2>Jesus Speaking: Heart to Heart with the King</h2><p>Jesus began speaking to French mystic Gabrielle Bossis when she was in her sixties.

It was midmorning and the temperature was already eighty degrees. The bullet had gone in clean, execution style, behind the ear. All signs suggested that he&#x2019;d been killed right here, in a narrow alley separating a parking garage from the historic Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament.<br><br>There didn&#x2019;t appear to be signs of struggle, but here in the decrepit underside of Sacramento, that was difficult to determine. While the city did a fairly good job at keeping most of the streets clean, on the north side of downtown, away from the Capitol building and closer to the soup kitchen, the grime and unwanted bred. Here, homeless weeded through the garbage off K Street for something edible when the city rolled up the sidewalks; or they slept against brick walls, clutching their meager possessions in a desperate grip.<br><br>No sign of struggle, and based on the lack of blood spatter, the victim had been prone when shot at close range. But he had the same outward injuries as the other two known victims. His hamstrings had been cut clean through, incapacitating him. His wrists had been duct-taped to something, as evidenced from the chafing and band of missing arm hair. And he was barefoot.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you thinking?&#x201d;<br><br>Megan stood and, though she was five foot eight, she had to look up at Detective John Black, who had to be close to six and a half feet tall.<br><br>&#x201c;All the appearances of an execution, but you&#x2019;re absolutely right. The M.O. matches the murders on the recent FBI hot sheet.&#x201d; And to maintain good relations with local law enforcement, she added, &#x201c;You were right on the money there. Thanks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;His hamstrings weren&#x2019;t cut here. Not enough blood. No spray or cast-off.&#x201d;<br><br>Megan glanced around, but there was no blood on the brick wall or in the alleyway. Where had he been attacked?<br><br>Without touching the filthily clad victim, she inspected the deep gash in the back of his legs. She mim?icked a slicing motion with her hand and then said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need the coroner&#x2019;s report, but it appears that the killer sliced right to left, cutting both legs with an even, fluid motion.&#x201d; She stood and said, &#x201c;Turn around.&#x201d;<br><br>Black did, looking over his shoulder. She said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re much taller than the victim. If the victim was walking, the killer would have had to have walked up behind him and&#x2014;slice&#x2014;cut the hamstrings.&#x201d; She mim-icked the motion against the back of Black&#x2019;s knees. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the only thing that makes sense. If the vic was lying down, why would the killer slice his legs across?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It would help if we could locate where he was attacked.&#x201d;<br><br>Megan agreed. &#x201c;If the vic went down on his knees, that should be obvious at the autopsy with bruising or evidence on his pants. But why shoot him here? Why did the killer move him at all after the inital attack?&#x201d;<br><br>Wearing latex gloves and plastic booties over her shoes, an attractive, well-dressed woman who may have been thirty on her last birthday approached. &#x201c;Nice theory, but maybe you should wait for crime scene analysis.&#x201d;<br><br>Black&#x2019;s lips twitched. &#x201c;Simone, FBI Supervisory Agent Megan Elliott. Agent Elliott, Simone Charles, CSU Supervisor.&#x201d;<br><br>Megan nodded. She&#x2019;d worked with the prickly perfectionist before. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve met. So, what does the evidence show, Simone?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My team just came off a triple murder in the Pocket. Sorry for being late.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t sound sorry, but Megan noticed the red eyes and tight expression. She&#x2019;d heard about the murder-suicide before she&#x2019;d left FBI headquarters. A man came home early in the morning, drunk, and shot his wife and two kids while they slept, then blew his own brains out.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not late,&#x201d; Megan said.<br><br>Simone motioned for one of her team to photograph the scene and the body. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll walk the area and be right back. You have a wide perimeter,&#x201d; she noted to Detective Black. &#x201c;Any reason?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;To keep the vultures at bay.&#x201d; He nodded toward the KCRA-3 van parked at the edge of the crime scene tape.<br><br>She grinned and walked away, dropping markers at specific spots.<br><br>Black said, &#x201c;So was he killed here or not?&#x201d;<br><br>Megan clarified. &#x201c;He was definitely shot right here, small-caliber handgun is my guess, twenty-two caliber, behind the left ear. A twenty-two is very effective at close range.&#x201d;<br><br>Megan had seen far too many execution-style murder victims when she was part of the national Evidence Response Team that went to Kosovo ten years ago. Which led to the question of why disable the victim first if only to shoot him?<br><br>If the evidence held true compared with the first two known victims, Megan already had the answer: between the time the victim&#x2019;s hamstrings were cut to when he was shot, someone had received sick pleasure from torturing him. Handicapping the victim was to keep him from escaping.<br><br>&#x201c;We need to find out where he was attacked and tortured,&#x201d; Megan said.<br><br>The two previous victims had no visible marks until their clothing was removed. Then dozens of tiny pinpricks were obvious. &#x201c;He plays before he kills.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br><br>Megan had forgotten that she wasn&#x2019;t alone. The members of Squad Eight&#x2014;the Violent Crimes/Major Offender Squad that she headed&#x2014;were used to her talking to herself; she had to remember she was out of her element here, assisting SPD.<br><br>&#x201c;Just thinking out loud.&#x201d;<br><br>Megan itched to inspect the victim&#x2019;s feet, but she didn&#x2019;t want to touch the body until the coroner&#x2019;s unit arrived.<br><br>First Austin, Texas, then Las Vegas, Nevada. Now Sacramento, California. The only thing those three places had in common, on the surface, was that they were large cities. The victims were single, male, between the ages of thirty-five and forty-five, tortured and murdered in their homes. While most serial predators stayed within one race, the first victim was black and the second and third were white. The first vic owned his own business and, though divorced, was by all accounts a devoted father. The second vic had never married, had a rap sheet for minor drug charges, and worked as a mechanic. There was some indication that he had a gambling problem, which delayed the local police from reporting the crime to the national database, mistakenly believing it was payback for an uncollected debt. The hot sheet possibly linking the two had only been sent out late last week.<br><br>As if reading her mind, or simply breathing too deeply, Black got on the radio and said to someone, &#x201c;This body is cooking and it&#x2019;s only going to get hotter. ETA of the coroner?&#x201d;<br><br>A gender-neutral voice replied, &#x201c;On scene.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Great.&#x201d; Black looked around, frowned, and said to Megan, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll find him.&#x201d; He stalked off.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t standard procedure for an FBI agent to go out to crime scenes alone, even aiding the local P.D., but there had been no initial certainty that this homicide was connected to the two other murders. Because her squad was already spread extremely thin, Megan had opted to check the scene herself.<br><br>But there was no doubt in her mind after viewing the body that the murder of this homeless man was connected somehow to the murders in Texas and Nevada. Why and how were the two big questions other than, of course, who.<br><br>She would wait to call it in until she had more information.<br><br>Megan frowned as she visually inspected the body again. Something else struck her as odd. Because the victim was homeless and had been living on the streets long enough to disappear into the backdrop of Sacramento, his age was indeterminate. At first glance, he could be as young as thirty, but the ravages of drugs and alcohol or simply the hard years living on the streets aged him. His clothes hadn&#x2019;t been washed in weeks or longer, so his hands stood out.<br><br>They were clean.<br><br>She looked around for someone from the CSU or SPD, but all she saw were uniforms, and they eyed her apprehensively. Her boss, Bob Richardson, had made great inroads working with local law enforcement, but there were always a few who blamed the &#x201c;Fibbies&#x201d; for everything bad that happened on a call.<br><br>She took out her BlackBerry and snapped a couple photographs. Not SOP, but she didn&#x2019;t plan to use the photos as evidence. She wanted to remember to ask the CSU about the hands, and this was Megan&#x2019;s reminder.<br><br>Were clean hands part of the killer&#x2019;s ritual? Or was this something new? Or special for this victim? Did this homeless man have some sort of hand-washing compulsion?<br><br>Or maybe there had been evidence on his hands and the killer had cleaned them. Very little could destroy evidence if the lab and technicians were good enough. But bleach or another caustic cleanser could be a sign that the victim had fought back and the killer had tried to conceal the evidence.<br><br>She knelt down and sniffed close to the hands.</p><h2>City of Bones (Harry Bosch)</h2><p><b>When a dog unearths evidence of a murder in the Hollywood Hills, Detective Harry Bosch must tackle a cold case that sparks memories he's tried to forget.</b><br>It's a cold case, but for Detective Harry Bosch, it stirs up memories of his childhood as an orphan. He can't let it go. As the investigation takes Bosch deeper into the past, a beautiful rookie cop brings him alive in the present. No official warning can break them apart--or prepare Bosch for the explosions when the case takes a few hard turns. Suddenly all of L.A. is in an uproar, and Bosch, fighting to keep control, is driven to the brink of an unimaginable decision.</p><p>Since his first appearance in 1992's Edgar-winning <i>The Black Echo</i>, Detective Hieronymous "Harry" Bosch has joined Dennis Lehane's Patrick and Angie, George Pelecanos's Derek Strange, and Greg Rucka's Atticus Kodiak in the pantheon of new-school hard-boiled detectives. Rather than giving Bosch a clever gimmick (like Jeffery Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme, who is a quadriplegic), Michael Connelly embraces the noir archetype: Bosch, an L.A. homicide detective, is a chain-smoking loner who refuses to play by his superiors' rules. Although he has quit smoking, Harry's still the same tightlipped outsider, taking each crime as a personal affront as he tries to cleanse his beloved city of the darkness he sees engulfing it. <p> In <i>City of Bones</i>, Connelly's eighth Bosch title, Bosch and his well-dressed partner, Jerry Edgar, are working to identify a child's skeleton, buried for 20 years in the forest off Hollywood's Wonderland Drive, and to bring the killer to belated justice. For Bosch this is more than just another homicide, as the mystery child, beaten and abandoned, comes to represent much of what he sees as evil in his city. Add in a tragic love affair with a fellow cop, complications from overzealous media, and the growing feeling that he's fighting a losing battle about which no one cares, and the usually stoic Bosch is pushed to his limits. This isn't the strongest plot Connelly has concocted for Bosch, but it leads to an ending the whole series has been building toward. The conclusion may not shock longtime fans, but it will leave them wondering where the series will go from here. <i>--Benjamin Reese</i></p>Michael Connelly is a former journalist and has won every major prize for crime fiction.

He reveals how these 200,000-year-old sites perfectly match Sumerian descriptions of Abzu, the land of the First People--including the vast gold-mining operations of the Anunnaki from the 12th planet, Nibiru, and the city of Anunnaki leader Enki. <br> <br>With aerial photographs, Tellinger shows how the extensive stone circle and road complexes are laid out according to the principles of sacred geometry and represent the remains of Tesla-like technology used to generate energy and carve immensely long tunnels straight into the Earth in search of gold--tunnels that still exist and whose origins had been a mystery until now. He reveals, with photographic evidence, that the human civilization spawned by the Anunnaki was the first to create many totems of ancient Egypt, such as the Horus bird, the Sphinx, the Ankh, and large pyramids, as well as construct an accurate stone calendar, at the heart of their civilization, aligned with the Orion constellation. He explores how their petroglyphs, carved into the hardest rock, are nearly identical to the hieroglyphs of Sumerian seals. <br> <br>Mapping thousands of square miles of continuous settlements and three urban centers--each one larger than modern-day Los Angeles--Tellinger provides the physical proof of Zecharia Sitchin&#x2019;s theories on the Anunnaki origins of humanity.</p><p>Michael Tellinger is a scientist, researcher, and regular guest on more than 200 radio shows in the United States, United Kingdom, and Europe, such as Coast to Coast AM with George Noory and the Shirley Maclaine Show.

A former game designer and editor, he lives in southern Wisconsin with his wife, Andria.One<br><br> Woteba.<br><br> The last time Han Solo had been here, the planet had had no name. The air had been thick and boggy, and there had been a ribbon of muddy water purling through the marsh grass, bending lazily toward the dark wall of a nearby conifer forest. A jagged mountain had loomed in the distance, its pale summit gleaming against the wispy red veil of a nebular sky.<br><br> Now the air was filled with the aroma of sweet membrosia and slow-roasted nerf ribs, and the only water in sight was rippling down the face of an artificial waterfall. The conifer forest had been cut, stripped, and driven into the marsh to serve as log pilings beneath the iridescent tunnel-houses of the Saras nest. Even the mountain looked different, seeming to float above the city on a cushion of kiln steam, its icy peak almost scraping the pale-veined belly of the Utegetu Nebula.<br><br> &#x201c;Interesting, what the bugs have done to the place,&#x201d; Han said. He was standing in the door of the glimmering hangar where they had berthed the Falcon, looking out on the nest along with Leia, Saba Sebatyne, the Skywalkers, and C-3PO and R2-D2. &#x201c;Not so creepy after all.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t call them bugs, Han,&#x201d; Leia reminded him. &#x201c;Insulting your hosts is never a good way to start a visit.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Right, we wouldn&#x2019;t want to insult &#x2019;em,&#x201d; Han said. &#x201c;Not for a little thing like harboring pirates and running black membrosia.&#x201d;<br><br> He crossed a spinglass bridge and stopped at the edge of a meandering ribbon of street. The silver lane was packed with chest-high Killiks hauling rough lumber, quarried moirestone, casks of bluewater. Here and there, bleary-eyed spacers&#x2014;human and otherwise&#x2014;were staggering back to their ships at the sore end of a membrosia binge. On the balconies overhanging the tunnel-house entrances, glittered-up Joiners&#x2014;beings who had spent too much time among Killiks and been absorbed into the nest&#x2019;s collective mind&#x2014;were smiling and dancing to the soft trill of spinning wind horns. The only incongruous sight was in the marshy, two-meter gap that served as the gutter between the hangar and the street. A lone insect lay facedown in the muck, its orange thorax and white-striped abdomen half covered in some sort of dull gray froth.<br><br> &#x201c;Raynar must know we&#x2019;ve arrived,&#x201d; Luke said. He was still on the bridge behind Han. &#x201c;Any sign of a guide?&#x201d;<br><br> The bug in the gutter lifted itself on its arms and began to drum its thorax.<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Han answered, eyeing the bug uncertainly. When it began to drag itself toward the bridge, he said, &#x201c;Make that a maybe.&#x201d;<br><br> The Killik stopped and stared up at them with a pair of bulbous green eyes. &#x201c;Bur r rruubb, ubur ruur.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sorry&#x2014;don&#x2019;t understand a throb.&#x201d; Han knelt on the street&#x2019;s glimmering surface and extended a hand. &#x201c;But come on up. Our protocol droid knows over six million&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> The insect spread its mandibles and backed away, pointing at the blaster on Han&#x2019;s hip.<br><br> &#x201c;Hey, take it easy,&#x201d; Han said, still holding out his hand. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s just for show. I&#x2019;m not here to shoot anybody.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Brubr.&#x201d; The Killik raised a pincer-hand, then tapped itself between the eyes. &#x201c;Urrubb uu.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, dear,&#x201d; C-3PO said from the back of the bridge. &#x201c;She seems to be asking you to blast her.&#x201d;<br><br> The bug nodded enthusiastically, then averted its eyes.<br><br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get crazy,&#x201d; Han said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not that late.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s in pain, Han.&#x201d; Mara knelt on the street beside Han and motioned the insect to come closer. &#x201c;Come here. We&#x2019;ll try to help.&#x201d;<br><br> The Killik shook its head and tapped itself between the eyes again. &#x201c;Buurubuur, ubu ru.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;She says nothing can help,&#x201d; C-3PO said. &#x201c;She has the Fizz.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The Fizz?&#x201d; Han echoed.<br><br> The Killik thrummed a long explanation.<br><br> &#x201c;She says it is very painful,&#x201d; C-3PO said. &#x201c;And she would appreciate it if you would end her misery as soon as possible. UnuThul is waiting in the Garden Hall.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Han said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not blasting anyone this trip.&#x201d;<br><br> The Killik rumbled something that sounded like rodder, then started to drag itself away.<br><br> &#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; Luke extended his hand, and the Killik rose out of the mud. &#x201c;Maybe we can rig an isolation ward&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> The rest of the offer was drowned out as Saras porters turned to point at their nest-fellow&#x2019;s frothy legs, drumming their chests and knocking the loads out of one another&#x2019;s arms. The Joiner dancers vanished from their balconies, and startled spacers staggered toward the gutter, squint- ing and reaching for their blasters.<br><br> Luke began to float the Killik back toward the bridge. It clacked its mandibles in protest and thrashed its arms, but its legs&#x2014;hidden beneath a thick layer of froth&#x2014;dangled motionlessly beneath its thorax. A steady drizzle of what looked like dirt specks fell from its feet into the gutter.<br><br> Han frowned. &#x201c;Luke, maybe we&#x2019;d better leave&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> A blaster bolt whined out from down the street, taking the Killik in midthorax and spraying a fist-sized circle of chitin and froth onto the hangar&#x2019;s milky exterior. The insect died instantly, but another uproar erupted on the street as angry spacers began to berate a wobbly Quarren holding a powerful Merr-Sonn Flash 4 blaster pistol.<br><br> &#x201c;Ish not my fault!&#x201d; The Quarren waved the weapon vaguely in Luke&#x2019;s direction. &#x201c;Them Jedi wash the ones flyin&#x2019; a Fizzer &#x2019;round.&#x201d;<br><br> The accusation diverted the angry looks toward Luke, but no one in the group was membrosia-smeared enough to harangue a party that included four beings dressed in Jedi robes. Instead the spacers staggered toward the hangar&#x2019;s other entrances as fast as their unsteady legs could carry them, leaving Han and the Jedi to stare at the dead Killik in astonished silence. Normally, they would have at least taken the killer into custody to await local law enforcement, but these were hardly normal circumstances. Luke just sighed and lowered the victim back into the gutter.<br><br> Leia seemed unable to take her eyes off it. &#x201c;From the way those spacers reacted, this is fairly common. Did Raynar&#x2019;s message say anything about an epidemic?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not a word,&#x201d; Mara said, standing. &#x201c;Just that Unu had discovered why the Dark Nest attacked me last year, and we needed to discuss it in person.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like it,&#x201d; Han said. &#x201c;Sounds more convenient all the time.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We know&#x2014;and thanks again for coming,&#x201d; Mara said. &#x201c;We appreciate the backup.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yeah, well, don&#x2019;t mention it.&#x201d; Han returned to his feet. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a personal interest in this.&#x201d;<br><br> Strictly speaking, the pirate harboring and membrosia running in which the Killiks were engaged was not Han and Leia&#x2019;s concern. But Chief of State Omas was using the trouble as a pretext to avoid keeping his side of a complicated bargain with the Solos, saying that until the nests of the Utegetu Nebula stopped causing so much trouble for the Galactic Alliance, he could not muster the votes he needed to give the Ithorians a new homeworld. <br><br> Han would have liked to believe the claim was just a big bantha patty, but someone had leaked the terms of the deal to the holopress. Now both the Solo name and the Ithorian homeworld had become linked in the public mind with the pirate raids and &#x201c;tarhoney&#x201d; dens that were blighting the frontier from Adumar to Reecee.<br><br> Once the street traffic had returned to normal, Luke said, &#x201c;We seem to be out a guide. We&#x2019;ll have to find Raynar ourselves.&#x201d;<br><br> Han started to send C-3PO into the street to ask directions from a Killik, but Luke and the other Masters simply turned to Leia with an expectant look. She closed her eyes for a moment, then turned down the street and confidently began to lead the way deeper into the shimmering nest. Fairly certain that she knew exactly where she was going, Han fell in beside C-3PO and R2-D2 and followed the others in silence. Sometimes hanging out with Jedi was almost enough to make him feel inadequate.<br><br> For a quarter of a standard hour, the nature of Saras nest did not change. They continued to meet long lines of Killik porters coming in the opposite direction, to crave the roasted nerf they smelled in the air, to marvel at the iridescent sheen of the sinuous tunnel-houses&#x2014;and to gasp at the purling beauty of the endless string of fountains, sprays, and cascades they passed.<br><br> Most of the Killik nests Han had visited had left him feeling creepy and a little sick to his stomach. But this one made him feel oddly buoyant and relaxed, perhaps even rejuvenated, as though the most pleasant thing in the galaxy would be sitting on a tunnel-house balcony, sipping golden membrosia, and watching the Joiners dance.<br><br> It made Han wonder what the bugs were up to now.<br><br> Gradually, the streets grew less crowded, and the group began to notice more froth-covered bodies in the gutter. Most were already dead and half disintegrated, but a few remained intact enough to raise their heads and beg for a merciful end. Han found himself torn between the desire to stop their suffering and a reluctance to do something so drastic without understanding the situation. Fortunately, Luke was able to take the middle road, using the Force to render each victim unconscious.<br><br> Finally, Leia stopped about ten meters from an open expanse of marsh. The street continued, snaking through a brightly mottled sweep of bog flowers, but the road surface turned dull and frothy ahead, and the ends of the nearby tunnel-houses were being eaten by gray foam. In the center of the field stood a massive spinglass palace, its base a shapeless mass of ash-colored bubbles and its crown a braided tangle of iridescent turrets swimming with snakes of color.<br><br> &#x201c;Tell me that&#x2019;s not where Raynar was waiting,&#x201d; Han groaned. &#x201c;Because there&#x2019;s no way we&#x2019;re going&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Raynar Thul could not be waiting there,&#x201d; a gravelly voice said from a nearby tunnel-house. &#x201c;You should know that by now, Captain Solo.

Yet until now, few have recognized how relevant these powerful ideas are to individuals and their daily work. Every person at a desk, drafting table, workstation, or operating table must (like a factory) deal with the challenge of reducing the waste that creeps into their work. The same Lean principles that have improved efficiencies on the factory floor can be just as powerful&#x2015;in fact, far more so&#x2015;in helping individuals boost personal performance. </p> <p><strong>Winner of a 2013 Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award!</strong></p><p><strong>A Factory of One: Applying Lean Principles to Banish Waste and Improve Your Personal Performance</strong> describes how you can foster a new mindset and improve your performance by applying Lean methods to your work.

This practice will help you develop better self-awareness, more disciplined problem-solving skills, and the ability to self-correct errors. </p> <p>This book not only provides the tools, but also teaches you how to find the root causes underlying your inefficiencies so you can eliminate them permanently.

No other contemporary reader provides such a broad and yet critical view of the issues typically addressed in an introductory foundations course. Instead, most provide a generic and typically conservative perspective on schools and classrooms and do little to encourage students to consider the important roles of critical theory and social justice in the creation of school environments that are responsive to issues of equity and diversity. This book provides a different lens through which students can view what happens in twenty-first-century schools while also considering the perspectives of multiple constituencies: parents, teachers, students and communities. The reader of this text is exposed to a wide range of scholarship in the foundations of education; essays range from the more traditional work of John Dewey to the controversial ideas of Henry Giroux. Contested topics associated with teaching, learning and leading in contemporary public schools are considered within a context where grappling with the answers to fundamental questions that will ultimately guide meaningful school reform is an essential part of becoming an educator. Each of the five sections in the book is accompanied by an introduction and summary/reflection questions to both guide reading and challenge students to think critically about how to synthesize and apply the ideas being presented.</p><p>Eleanor Blair (PhD, University of Tennessee, Knoxville) is Associate Professor at Western Carolina University (WCU).

( Author ) ] Paperback 2013</p><p><b>Q &amp; A with Dr. Samir Desai</b><br><b></b><b></b><b></b><b>Why did you write this book?</b><br>Having served on the medical school admissions committee for years, I've been amazed at the quality of today's applicants. I'm not alone in the way that I feel. At conferences and meetings, I often interact with admissions officials all across the country. When we get together, many of us wonder if we would get into medical school today. "I can't believe how much she's done," is something I hear time and time again from my colleagues.<br>The sad reality, though, is that sometimes stars on paper are less than impressive in person. The medical school interview is a high stakes situation, and the pressure of the situation can easily make talented applicants appear lacking in one or more ways.&nbsp;<br>It's always been upsetting to me to see worthy applicants who have so much to offer our profession denied that chance because of a poor interview performance. That's what led me to write this book - to give you insider information that you can use to elevate your interview performance, and leave the interviewer with a powerful impression.<br>An impression that makes the interviewer return to the admissions committee to say, "I interviewed 5 applicants today but Applicant X was by and far the best. I would love to see her at our school."<br>I want you to be Applicant X. That's why I have created this incredibly detailed book chock full of powerful strategies.&nbsp;<br><b>What else is important to know about this book?</b><br>I didn't want this book just to be the opinion of one or two authors. That's why I exhaustively researched the field to provide you with the evidence that supports our recommendations. Of course, not every aspect of the medical school interview has been researched. When research was lacking, I reached out to admissions directors, deans, and interviewers to share with you their perspectives. <b>Inside this book, you will find 182 quotes and comments from admissions officials.</b><br><b>How can this book specifically help me deliver a compelling interview performance?</b><br>Inside, you will:<br><ul><li>Learn about the goals of the interviewer, and how you can meet them.</li><li>Discover the qualities interviewers are seeking, and how can demonstrate them.</li><li>Avoid demonstrating qualities that may harm your chances of admission, some of which are surprisingly easy to make.</li><li>Find ways to show your motivation for a career in medicine, an important part of your overall interview score.</li><li>Avoid common pitfalls and traps in answering the question "Why do you want to be a doctor?"</li><li>Be able to discuss your commitment to service in a way that resonates with the interviewer.</li><li>Learn how to present yourself as a "good fit" for the school.</li><li>See how to demonstrate personal maturity through your answers.</li><li>Benefit from our list of common ethical dilemmas asked of medical school applicants, and an approach to answering these questions.</li><li>Learn how to properly research a medical school and use the information to elevate your performance.</li><li>Discover how to stand out in different interview formats, including the traditional, group, panel, behavioral, and multiple mini interview (MMI). Note that this book provides an overview of the MMI. See our companion book "Multiple Mini Interview: Winning Strategies from Admissions Faculty" for detailed strategies for success.</li><li>Identify ways to address red flags in your application (low grades, low MCAT scores, leave of absence, issues with professionalism, institutional action, significant time gaps)</li><li>Determine how to shine at the beginning, during the body, and at the end of the interview.</li><li>Know what to do if you don't know the answer to a question.</li><li>Avoid asking the "wrong" questions.</li><li>Discover ways to answer illegal or inappropriate questions.</li><li>Know what to do after the interview to maximize your chances of an offer.</li><li>See how to increase your chances of securing a position from the waitlist.</li><li>Find tips and strategies for the osteopathic interview.</li></ul><br>And much more!<br><b>Are there any samples answers to commonly asked interview questions?</b><br>We devote an entire chapter on how to answer interview questions. This chapter includes case studies of medical school applicants. A sample answer is offered and this is followed by a discussion of how the applicant could have answered the question better. Then we utilize these discussion points to show you the better answer.&nbsp;<br><b>What other interview resources do you offer?</b><br>In our "Success in Medicine" podcast (co-hosted by Dr. Samir Desai and Dr. Rajani Katta), we offer very specific medical school tips and strategies for different medical schools. You can access the free podcast at iTunes and Google Play.

Impressive.&nbsp; <i>Cannibalism </i>restores my faith in humanity.&#x201d; </b>&#x2014;<b>Sy Montgomery, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br> For centuries scientists have written off cannibalism as a bizarre phenomenon with little biological significance. Its presence in nature was dismissed as a desperate response to starvation or other life-threatening circumstances, and few spent time studying it. A taboo subject in our culture, the behavior was portrayed mostly through horror movies or tabloids sensationalizing the crimes of real-life flesh-eaters. But the true nature of cannibalism--the role it plays in evolution as well as human history--is even more intriguing (and more normal) than the misconceptions we&#x2019;ve come to accept as fact.<br><br> In <i>Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History</i>,<i></i>zoologist Bill Schutt sets the record straight, debunking common myths and investigating our new understanding of cannibalism&#x2019;s role in biology, anthropology, and history in the most fascinating account yet written on this complex topic. Schutt takes readers from Arizona&#x2019;s Chiricahua Mountains, where he wades through ponds full of tadpoles devouring their siblings, to the Sierra Nevadas, where he joins researchers who are shedding new light on what happened to the Donner Party--the most infamous episode of cannibalism in American history. He even meets with an expert on the preparation and consumption of human placenta (and, yes, it goes well with Chianti).<br><br> Bringing together the latest cutting-edge science, Schutt answers questions such as why some amphibians consume their mother&#x2019;s skin; why certain insects bite the heads off their partners after sex; why, up until the end of the twentieth century, Europeans regularly ate human body parts as medical curatives; and how cannibalism might be linked to the extinction of the Neanderthals. He takes us into the future as well, investigating whether, as climate change causes famine, disease, and overcrowding, we may see more outbreaks of cannibalism in many more species--including our own.<br><br><i>Cannibalism </i>places a perfectly natural occurrence into a vital new context and invites us to explore why it both enthralls and repels us.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>&#x201c;A clear-headed, sometimes humorous, sometimes tragic--and always fascinating--compendium of one of Western culture&#x2019;s strongest taboos.&#x201d;*</b><br><br> Until just recently, cannibalism was considered rare and abnormal in both humans and other animals. Now zoologist Bill Schutt surveys the latest research and delves into biology and anthropology, as well as history, literature, mythology, and pop culture, to bring us the first full-scale work on what science has come to recognize as completely natural behavior.<br><br> &#x201c;Butterflies do it. So do some toads, birds, and polar bears. Did dinosaurs do it? What about the Neanderthals? And what about us, for that matter? If you&#x2019;re hungry for a fun, absorbing read about which animals eat their own kind and why, read this book.&#x201d; <b>&#x2014;Virginia Morell, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Animal Wise: How We Know Animals Think and Feel</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;A deliciously entertaining smorgasbord of scientific reality.

His first book, <i>Dark Banquet: Blood and the Curious Lives of Blood-Feeding Creatures, </i>was selected as a Best Book of 2008 by <i>Library Journal </i>and Amazon and was chosen for the Barnes &amp; Noble Discover Great New Writers program. Born in New York City and raised on Long Island by parents who encouraged his love for turning over stones and peering under logs, Schutt quickly grew a passion for the natural world, with its enormous wonders and its increasing vulnerability. He received his PhD in zoology from Cornell and has published over two dozen peer-reviewed articles on topics ranging from terrestrial locomotion in vampire bats to the precarious, arboreal copulatory behavior of a marsupial mouse.

Do you feel happy How long has it been since you felt a level of contagious, infectious, unflappable, unstoppable happiness Maybe your answer is, &#34;All the time.&#34; If so, God bless you! (And consider suggesting this book to someone who needs it.) For many of us the answer is, &#34;Well, it&#39;s been a while. I used to be happy, but then life took its toll.&#34; Only one-third of Americans surveyed said they were happy. How can this be Education is accessible to most. We&#39;ve made advancements in everything from medicine to technology, yet 66 percent of us can&#39;t find an adequate reason to check the &#34;yes&#34; box on the happiness questionnaire. Worldwide, people profess that happiness is their most cherished goal. Marketers get this. &#34;Want to be happy&#34; they ask. Eat at this restaurant, drive this car, wear this dress.

When applied in the right ways, your God-given passion produces clear-eyed purpose, deep compassion, and a bold spirit that can change the world. But sometimes your determination leads to misunderstandings and fractured relationships.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cynthia Tobias knows firsthand the positive potential of a strong will channeled appropriately. In <i>A Woman of Strength and Purpose, </i>she offers practical strategies for applying your confidence and drive to enrich your friendships, career, ministry, marriage, and parenting. You&#x2019;ll also hear from hundreds of other women who share your strong will and the desire to use it for God.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> You don&#x2019;t need to silence your strengths. Instead, let God use them to impact your world for good.</p><p><b>Cynthia Ulrich Tobias, M.Ed.</b>,&nbsp;has a successful background that includes more than thirty years as an author and popular speaker for businesses, churches, and schools around the world; eight years of teaching public high school; and six years in law enforcement.&nbsp; She has written numerous books and is often a featured guest on radio and television.&nbsp; She and her husband, Jack, live in the Seattle area.<b>WHO SAYS I&#x2019;M A Strong-Willed WOMAN?<br></b><br> S<i>trong-Willed Woman. </i>It&#x2019;s a galvanizing phrase. It evokes an immediate reaction&#x2014;either positive or negative. There&#x2019;s no middle ground, no indifference. It&#x2019;s a term that is not neutral.<br><br>There are those who believe the term <i>strong willed </i>is auto�matically negative, describing a person who is stubborn, defiant, and difficult to deal with. But that&#x2019;s not the definition of strong will&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what happens when strong will goes sideways. Strong will, in and of itself, is a positive trait; it describes a per�son who is energized, resourceful, and determined to succeed.<br><br>I am a strong-willed woman (SWW). I grew up the daugh�ter of an evangelical pastor, and I never rebelled against my dad. I didn&#x2019;t talk back to a teacher or get loud, obnoxious, or rude. I tell people that you couldn&#x2019;t have traced even half the trouble I caused back to me! Outwardly I was compliant and coopera�tive. But if someone pointed a finger in my face, if someone told me something simply couldn&#x2019;t be done&#x2014;that&#x2019;s when I dug in my heels and pushed back.<br><br> As I grew up, I had other strong-willed friends who were more independent, extroverted, and outspoken. Although some were unlike me in many ways, we all shared the same basic traits that make strong will such a positive force for good. We weren&#x2019;t afraid to tackle tough situations; we didn&#x2019;t back down just because circumstances were difficult. If we didn&#x2019;t know what to do, we figured out that someone in our network of friends and contacts would help us accomplish the goal. We excelled in finding creative alternatives.<br><br>During my first year of teaching high school, for instance, I was the girls&#x2019; drill team faculty advisor. That meant getting forty high school girls to every football game. Unfortunately, I quickly found out that school bus drivers were scarce. Other people might just shrug, wring their hands, and say, &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s just the way it is.&#x201d; But I thought, <i>How hard can it be to drive a bus?</i><br><br> The next Sunday at church I pulled aside the Sunday school director and pointed to the seventy-two-passenger school bus parked outside. &#x201c;Pastor Bob, can someone teach me to drive that bus?&#x201d;<br><br>He smiled. &#x201c;I can make that happen.&#x201d;<br><br>In short order, I passed the driving test and got my special license&#x2014;and my drill team girls had a reliably available school bus driver.<br><br>Because we quickly get a reputation as someone who can get the job done, SWWs tend to be called upon to figure out tough issues for other people too. All my life my family and friends have turned to me when they run into particularly hard situations: <i>There are no hotel rooms available. I can&#x2019;t find a rental car under sixty-five dollars a day. No one can figure out how to get there. </i>It&#x2019;s not that I have special skills; I just don&#x2019;t like taking no for an answer. I&#x2019;m against giving up or admitting defeat when it&#x2019;s really important that something gets done.<br><br>Years ago, when I started traveling a lot for speaking en�gagements, the airlines had a rule that in order to get the best fares, you had to stay over a Saturday night. One weekend I was finished speaking at my event. Knowing that my young twins were both sick with colds, I decided I needed to head home even though it was still Saturday. I called the airline to see if I could get a flight out that night. The customer-service person informed me that the Saturday night stay could not be waived without great expense, and that I would have to wait until Sunday morning. But I knew this airline had more than forty thousand employees, and every time I called the reservations number a different person answered the phone. I also knew there were several empty seats on that Saturday night flight, so I kept calling back until I found a reservation agent who would make the exception for me without penalty&#x2014;and I got home to my sick kids on Saturday night.<br><br>SWWs are experts at finding loopholes, figuring out a way around a rule that doesn&#x2019;t make sense, or maneuvering around even the biggest obstacles. They are undaunted, undeterred, and sometimes succeed just through sheer perseverance.<br><br>But this book isn&#x2019;t talking about just <i>any </i>kind of strong-willed woman. Strong will has a dark side, and when it takes the wrong turn, things can get ugly. Resourcefulness can turn into manipulation; creative solutions can become dishonest tactics; determination can present itself as purely stubborn pride. Every strong-willed woman has experienced both the light and dark sides of her nature. We know we are capable of great good&#x2014;or great destruction. The difference in how we use the power we have lies in whether or not we have dedicated it to the Creator and Designer of it.<br><br>When honoring God is our top priority, our greatest tri�umph is succeeding without cheating, being dishonest, or using any other tactic that would dishonor Him. As we&#x2019;re called upon to find unique solutions to problems or creative angles for at� tempting the impossible, we are fully committed to staying within the boundaries of God&#x2019;s law and direction and using our strong will to change the world for good. One woman put it this way: &#x201c;A strong will doesn&#x2019;t have to have negative conse�quences, especially if it keeps us following in the footsteps God wants us to follow. It might be a lifesaver.&#x201d;<br><br>So what do we mean by <i>strong-willed women</i>? If we were talking about an army, these women would qualify to be part of a special operations unit. Special ops members stand apart from the others, not necessarily because they are smarter or more gifted than those in the infantry, but because they are, quite simply, <i>bolder. </i>In God&#x2019;s army, we find strong-willed spe�cial ops women from all walks of life&#x2014;teachers, stay-at-home moms, CEOs, cashiers, homeschooling moms, entrepreneurs, missionaries, neurosurgeons, mail carriers. Whatever they do, wherever they are, they meet the world head-on&#x2014;unafraid, un�daunted, undeterred by those who tell them something can&#x2019;t be done. Each one is a woman with convictions of steel, willing to take the lead when called upon to use her passion, courage, and drive to withstand extraordinary conditions&#x2014;even when her commitment requires a seemingly impossible mission.<br><br>Today more than ever, we&#x2019;re in a battle between good and evil. There is an enemy who is determined to steal the hearts and minds of children, destroy marriages, crush ambitions, and redefine ethics and spiritual morality. This is no ordinary warfare, and the stakes are higher than temporary victory. The outcome of this warfare determines the destiny of every soul for eternity.<br><br>God doesn&#x2019;t force us to serve, but when we voluntarily en�list in His service, we become part of something greater than any of us, and He uses our strong will to accomplish more than we could have ever dreamed. As Paul reminded us in 1 Thes�salonians 1:4&#x2013;5: &#x201c;It is clear to us, friends, that God not only loves you very much but also has put his hand on you for some�thing special. When the Message we preached came to you, it wasn&#x2019;t just words. Something happened in you. The Holy Spirit put steel in your convictions.&#x201d; God gave us a strong will for a reason&#x2014;and He calls us to use it for Him.<br><br>The Enemy would have us think that it&#x2019;s wrong to possess strong will. He tries to make us feel guilty for using it or to discourage us from speaking up, especially in the church. That&#x2019;s because he knows that when strong will is voluntarily given to God and used for His purposes, it becomes a mighty force for God. Can you imagine how quickly the Enemy has to flee when faced with groups of godly, strong-willed women coming together to pray? Do you think these women will be reluctant to step up and fight injustice, crime, or any other evil? Will they be afraid to stand against what&#x2019;s wrong or be daunted by seem�ingly impossible tasks? I don&#x2019;t think so.<br><br>We won&#x2019;t all be called to fight in the same way&#x2014;some will be on the front lines; others will prefer to work in the background&#x2014;but every SWW serving God will play a critical role in carrying out His mission.<br><br><b>How Strong Willed Are You?<br></b><br>When it comes to identifying who is officially a strong-willed woman, you&#x2019;ll find a huge variety of strengths and character traits. While we have many things in common, none of us will ever fit into a typical profile and description. Every SWW is unique, with stories so diverse and life experiences so varied that sometimes the only thing we can count on is never being bored!<br><br>You may already be comfortable with your strong will, em�bracing it with enthusiasm, or you may be reluctant to admit you have it&#x2014;and resist using the term at all. You may live using intuition and spontaneity, or you might rely more on analysis and predictability. Strong will comes in all sizes, shapes, and personalities. But regardless of your background or uniqueness, you can use your strength to bring honor and glory to God&#x2014;and you&#x2019;re destined to change the world in ways you can&#x2019;t even imagine. After all, it&#x2019;s almost always the ones with the most determination who make the most difference.<br><br>Of course, there&#x2019;s no definitive test to determine who is and isn&#x2019;t strong willed, but the following checklist can give you a good idea of the degree of strong will you have. Since we often get a better perspective of ourselves through the eyes of those who love us, ask at least two other people who know you best to take this same checklist on your behalf and see if <i>their </i>score for you matches your own. (If you&#x2019;re married, be sure one of those people is your husband.)<br><br> <b>How Strong Is Your Will?<br></b><br>Put a check mark in front of each of the following statements that best describes you.<br><br> ___ 1. I can be very creative and resourceful when I need to accomplish a difficult goal.<br><br> ___ 2. I&#x2019;m not easily discouraged by circumstances if the goal is important to me.<br><br> ___ 3. I&#x2019;m willing to step up and take on a project when no one else will.<br><br> ___ 4. I am not easily intimidated.<br>___ 5. I don&#x2019;t automatically take no for an answer.<br><br> ___ 6. When given the ultimatum, &#x201c;Do it or else,&#x201d; my first reaction is, &#x201c;Or else what?&#x201d;<br><br> ___ 7. I usually become the leader in a group.<br><br> ___ 8. If the rule doesn&#x2019;t make sense to me, I look for ways around it.<br><br> ___ 9.

I don&#x2019;t shy away from adventure or steps of faith if I really believe God has told me to do something.<br><br> ___ 11. I&#x2019;ve been told I don&#x2019;t apologize as quickly or as often as I should.<br><br> ___ 12. When backed into a corner, I&#x2019;m more likely to keep fighting than to just give up.<br><br> Total _____<br><br> If you scored between eight and twelve, you definitely qualify as a strong-willed woman! If you scored less than eight, you probably think that you really don&#x2019;t have all that much strong will, and yet, as you read through this book, you might be surprised how many times you recognize yourself. Even if you don&#x2019;t come out high on the strong-willed scale, you&#x2019;ll find this book contains a wealth of knowl�edge for how to bring out the best in the strong-willed women you know and love.<br><br> <b>It TakesOne to Know One<br></b><br>You would expect the author of this book to be an SWW&#x2014;and I am. But there&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;d like to clear up right away. This book is not about me&#x2014;not all about my story or my views or my accomplishments. The truth is, God called me to write this book. I know you may think that sounds a little over the top, but I&#x2019;ve never been more sure about anything in my life.<br><br> I had to fight hard to put this book in your hands&#x2014;and the battles were not with flesh and blood. They were, and continue to be, fought against the Enemy of our souls. I know what Paul wrote about when he warned, &#x201c;We do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places&#x201d; (Ephesians 6:12, nkjv).<br><br> During the course of finding a home for this manuscript, some people told me: &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not reaching a broad enough range of women&#x2014;the audience for this subject is too narrow.&#x201d; My response? &#x201c;I believe it&#x2019;s a lot bigger than you think.&#x201d; Many people will be surprised by how many other godly SWWs are out there. In fact, I recruited several hundred of them to share, through a series of surveys and conversations, their thoughts, their struggles, and their advice. Oh, how I have enjoyed spend�ing more than a year reading and thinking about what they wrote! What a privilege it&#x2019;s been to pray for them by name and to trust God to provide the best way to weave their words into this book.<br><br> Throughout the following pages you&#x2019;ll read comments from some of the more than four hundred women who re�sponded to my surveys&#x2014;SWWs who have a heart for God. Their words are honest and unvarnished and offer intimate glimpses into the lives of those who struggle to keep their re�solve firmly under the control of the God they love and trust.<br><br> If you&#x2019;ve ever been accused of being too bossy, too control�ling, too intense; if you&#x2019;ve ever struggled with letting your hus�band lead or gone toe-to-toe with your stubborn child; if you&#x2019;ve ever wondered why the skills that make you so good at your job don&#x2019;t work at all in personal relationships; if you often wonder why some people don&#x2019;t <i>just snap out of it, </i>you&#x2019;ll find encourag�ing and intriguing answers in the following chapters. It&#x2019;s impor�tant to know that many women think a lot like you do.<br><br> Welcome to a book that understands you, written by some�one who gets who you are and how you&#x2019;re wired. No one who has contributed to this book will raise her eyebrows and say, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you think like that!&#x201d; You&#x2019;ll be <i>encouraged </i>as you recognize how positive your strong will is when it&#x2019;s pointed in the right direction. You&#x2019;ll feel <i>reaffirmed </i>as you discover how much you have in common with other women of such strength and purpose, and how &#x201c;normal&#x201d; you are. Most of all, you&#x2019;ll feel <i>challenged </i>as you identify the practical ways to use your gift of strong will to honor God and His purposes.<br><br> As you read these pages, you&#x2019;ll find insights and strategies for every relationship&#x2014;from leadership to friendships to mar�riage to parenting to, most importantly, your relationship with God. You&#x2019;ll smile as you read the comments, confessions, and advice from others who have walked in your shoes. You&#x2019;ll nod a lot and find yourself thinking, <i>That&#x2019;s me! </i>You may feel like one woman who wrote: &#x201c;My history with the phrase <i>strong willed </i>has the connotation of &#x2018;head butting&#x2019; or disobedience or selfishness. Is there something wonderful about this word that I&#x2019;ve been missing all these years?&#x201d;<br><br> Yes&#x2014;and you&#x2019;re about to find out what it is. Are you ready to start this adventure?</p><h2>The Liberating Image: The Imago Dei in Genesis 1</h2><p>For two thousand years, Christians have been intrigued by the somewhat enigmatic <i>Imago Dei</i> references in the book of Genesis. Much theological ink has been spilled mulling over the significance and meaning of these words: "Let us make humanity in our image, according to our likeness . . . "<br><br>In <i>The Liberating Image</i>, J. Richard Middleton takes on anew the challenge of interpreting the <i>Imago Dei</i>. Reflecting on the potential of the <i>Imago Dei</i> texts for developing an ethics of power rooted in compassion, he relates its significance to the Christian community's distinct calling in an increasingly violent world. <br><br><i>The Liberating Image</i> introduces a relevant, scholarly take on an important Christian doctrine. It will appeal to all Christians seeking to better understand what it means to be made in God's image.</p><p>"In an image-saturated culture that 'brands' personal identity in terms of consumer choices while rendering the planet an ecological wasteland, can the ancient biblical notion of humans created in the 'image of God' be good news? In a world of violence in which a 'war on terrorism' is given near-mythological legitimation by means of an us/them ideology that dismisses the 'enemy' as the forces of chaos opposed to the civilizational order of democratic capitalism, does the biblical view of creation offer a counter-ideological alternative? Richard Middleton thinks so. In this wonderfully rich book Middleton deeply respects the text as he attends to its rhetorical, historical, and cultural meaning in such a way that we might hear it speak to us anew. Here is 'theological' interpretation at its very best--an exhaustive and lucid study that will not only change how we think about the imago Dei but perhaps change how we engage in biblical scholarship."--Brian J. Walsh,! University of Toronto <p>"Middleton exhibits a powerful capacity for big issues, a patience with detail, and a sure theological sensibility. His study ranges all the way from comparative historical analysis to contemporary issues of ideology critique. The result is a study of a crucial biblical-theological phrase that is sure to become a benchmark in exegetical-hermeneutical work. Middleton's unwavering theological focus keeps the detail in the service of big issues, and culminates with a wondrous affirmation of a generous God. Such a God stands over against ancient modes of parsimonious violence and, by implication, over against contemporary practitioners of the same parsimonious violence. A most important read!"--Walter Brueggemann, Columbia Theological Seminary </p><p>"I have long thought that the description of humanity as made in God's image (along with the rest of Genesis 1-3) has been the subject of so much comment over the centuries that we could never get behind all that interpretation to its inherent meaning. Richard Middleton's fascinating book has made me think again."--John Goldingay, Fuller Theological Seminary </p><p>"Up-to-date interpretations of the Imago Dei have long been needed. Richard Middleton has accomplished this considerable feat with great learning and sophistication, both by gathering the issues so clearly and accessibly and by providing an important advance in thinking about this theme. He has presented an expert historical and literary analysis, ranging widely across extrabiblical and biblical literature. Even more, Middleton has drawn out significant theological dimensions of the text and demonstrated the ethical implications of his analysis--with a lively engagement of contemporary concerns. Readers will encounter here fresh ways of considering both God and the human beings created in the image of that God."--Terry Fretheim, Luther Seminary </p><p>"The Liberating Image is a balanced yet challenging articulation of the Imago Dei in Genesis, its ancient Near Eastern context, and its present-day theological implications. By locating himself in his postmodern context, Middleton brings a refreshing hermeneutical self-consciousness to the scholarly task, which is aimed at providing a substantive and compelling argument without posing as the last word. His analysis of Imago Dei in Genesis in the context of ancient Near Eastern religions leads Middleton to the conclusion that the Israelite theological traditions of Genesis 1-11 are recontextualized in conscious opposition to ideological categories of Mesopotamia. That Israel's story promotes the dignity of all humans, not just of the royal or priestly classes, should have vital ethical implications for today."--Peter Enns, Westminster Theological Seminary </p><p>"Richard Middleton has written a comprehensive and deep interpretation of the Imago Dei in the light of its immediate scriptural context as well as in relation to ancient Near Eastern understandings of the image of God and of the human. The value of this work, however, goes beyond those contributions. He has ventured to explore, in conversation with biblical scholars, theologians, and ethicists, some of the ethical and theological issues that arise from Genesis 1 and the human being as created in the image of God. The book is probably the most comprehensive treatment of this topic in the English language and will be an automatic point of reference in the continuing effort to understand the human in the light of scripture."--Patrick D. Miller, Princeton Theological Seminary </p><p>"J. Richard Middleton examines an exegetically worn phrase, 'the image of God,' and gives it a theological freshness. His careful attention to the Genesis context as the decisive factor for understanding this intriguing concept is a good example of exegetical method."--C. Hassell Bullock, Wheaton College </p><p>"Middleton's study of the Imago Dei represents biblical scholarship at its best. Here is a book that displays careful and meticulous research, balanced judgment, and insightful application, all of which are clearly and logically presented in a most readable fashion. By engaging meaningfully with current ethical debates that utilize the concept of Imago Dei, Middleton highlights the importance of his conclusions for contemporary discussion. Readers will find their horizons broadened and their preconceived ideas challenged by a work that contributes very positively to a better understanding of what Genesis 1 means when it states that human beings were made in the image of God."--T. Desmond Alexander, Union Theological College, Belfast </p><p>"Finally, in one book, an interdisciplinary (exegetical, hermeneutical, theological, and ethical) conversation on the Imago Dei. Beginning with a careful treatment of the biblical Imago Dei against its backdrop in ancient Near Eastern literature and ending with an ethical discussion of power and violence, Middleton deftly shows that imaging God is--surprise, surprise!--imaging God's wondrous generosity."--James H.

Packer,</strong> Board of Governors' Professor of Theology, Regent College</p><p>"Dr. Graham Cole's superbly written book is a thorough biblical and theological study of the doctrine of the Holy Spirit that may well become a standard work on the subject. The volume is marked by careful exegesis of the scriptural references to the Spirit, each of which is interpreted within the salvation-historical flow of God's redemptive purposes. A convinced Trinitarian theologian, Dr. Cole listens carefully to the contributions made by earlier generations of Christian writers from a range of disciplines, including biblical studies, systematic theology, and historical theology. Authors from both the Eastern and Western traditions are drawn in as pertinent, and challenging questions for our generation are raised.

When snow cuts off the mail until spring, only postman John Thompson can get through the Sierra Nevada Mountains to deliver his letter. "Based on a true story, this is lively historical fiction with a nice sense of character and adventure, [and] the illustrations are packed with feeling and action." &#x2014;BL. <p> Notable 1992 Children's Trade Books in Social Studies (NCSS/CBC)</p></p><p><p>Nancy Smiler Levinson has written many popular books for young readers, including <em>Magellan and the First Voyange Around the World</em> and the I Can Read Books <em>Clara and the Bookwagon,</em> illustrated by Carolyn Croll, and <em>Snowshoe Thompson,</em> illustrated by Joan Sandin.

Ms. Sandin lives in Tucson, AZ.</p>Kindergarten-Grade 3-- This fictionalized account of John Thompson's first winter trek across the Sierra Nevada in the mid-19th century will captivate many beginning readers. When mail delivery is halted because of heavy snows, Norwegian-born Thompson (one of American's skiing pioneers) volunteers to deliver a young California boy's letter to his father in Carson City, Nevada. The boy, Danny, helps him make a pair of skis--splitting and sanding the wood planks, boiling the wood, and shaping the tips. Sandin's watercolor illustrations add to the understanding and emotion of the easy-to-read text. The rugged appearance of the pioneers, the work involved in making the skis, and the developing friendship between Thompson and Danny are revealed through the artwork. The snowstorm, with its white and grays, dominates and blends the colors. Although most of the townfolk think Thompson is foolhardy to attempt a crossing, the boy's faith is unfailing. This tale is especially appealing set against the background of Danny's loneliness for his father. Don't miss this warm bit of historical fiction set in a cold forbidding climate.

Of the 650 Italian Jews in his shipment, Levi was one of only twenty who left the camps alive.

Levi, then a 25-year-old chemist, spent 10 months in the camp. Even Levi's most graphic descriptions of the horrors he witnessed and endured there are marked by a restraint and wit that not only gives readers access to his experience, but confronts them with it in stark ethical and emotional terms: "[A]t dawn the barbed wire was full of children's washing hung out in the wind to dry. Nor did they forget the diapers, the toys, the cushions and the hundred other small things which mothers remember and which children always need. Would you not do the same? If you and your child were going to be killed tomorrow, would you not give him something to eat today?" <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Primo Michele Levi (July 31, 1919 &#x2013; April 11, 1987) was an Italian Jewish chemist and writer. He was the author of two novels and several collections of short stories, essays, and poems. His best-known works include Survival in Auschwitz (1947), his account of the year he spent as a prisoner in the Auschwitz concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland; and The Periodic Table (1975) which the Royal Institution of Great Britain named the best science book ever written.</p><h2>The Oxford Introductions to U.S. Law: Property</h2><p><em>The Oxford Introductions to U.S. Law: Property</em> provides both a bird's eye overview of property law and an introduction to how property law affects larger concerns with individual autonomy, personhood, and economic organization.

He is a mentor, teacher, and trailblazer to many photographers, and a hero to those who feel Jay&#x2019;s teaching has changed the way they see and create their own photography. He is a living legend whose work is studied around the world, and whose teaching style and presentation garner standing ovations and critical acclaim every time he takes the stage.<br> <br>Now, for the first time ever, Jay puts his amazing insights and learning moments from a lifetime behind the lens into a book that communicates the three most important aspects of street photography: light, gesture, and color. Each page unveils something new and challenges you to rethink everything you know about the bigger picture of photography. This isn&#x2019;t a book about f-stops or ISOs. It&#x2019;s about seeing. It&#x2019;s about being surrounded by the ordinary and learning how to find the extraordinary. It&#x2019;s about training your mind, and your eyes, to see and capture the world in a way that delights, engages, and captivates your viewers, and there is nobody that communicates this, visually or through the written word, like Jay Maisel.<br> <br>Light, Gesture &amp; Color is the seminal work of one of the true photographic geniuses of our time, and it can be your key to opening another level of understanding, appreciation, wonder, and creativity as you learn to express yourself, and your view of the world, through your camera. If you&#x2019;re ready to break through the barriers that have held your photography back and that have kept you from making the types of images you&#x2019;ve always dreamed of, and you&#x2019;re ready to learn what photography is really about, you&#x2019;re holding the key in your hands at this very moment.<br> <br></p><p>Photographer Jay Maisel&#x2019;s career spans 61 years.

After reading this book, examinees will not only make full preparation for GRE examination, but also build vocabulary effectively.</p><p></p><h2>The Perfume of Silence</h2><p>This book is about enlightenment, spiritual awakening, self realization, meditation, awareness, consciousness, happiness, love, relationships, psychological suffering and human predicament. Based largely on actual dialogues between Francis Lucille, a spiritual teacher of non-duality, and some of his disciples, the music of freedom that it conveys resonates between the words, and gives the reader an inkling of the peace and happiness that are experienced in the presence of an authentic master. Francis Lucille was for over twenty years a close friend and disciple of Jean Klein, a well recognized French teacher of non-duality. They both belong to a lineage of Advaita Vedanta teachers stemming from India. (Advaita Vedanta is the main nondualist Hindu spiritual tradition). Jean Klein&#39;s guru, Pandit Veeraraghavachar, was a Professor at the Sanskrit College in Bengalore. Their teachings, despite some superficial similarities, are quite different from those of most contemporary western neo Advaita teachers.They emphasize for instance the importance of the direct transmission from guru to disciple, through presence, beyond words, and they recognize that the same universal truth was expressed by various saints, philosophers and teachers throughout history and across the world. That which matters here is not the form of the teaching, direct or gradual for instance, as much as the authenticity of the teacher, the vibrancy of his realization, the outpouring of his love, the freedom of his humour, the brilliancy of his intelligence, the splendor of his poetry, the spontaneous sharing of his peace. Nonduality is the common ground of Buddhism (especially Zen and Dzogchen), Advaita, Sufism, Taoism, the Kabbalah, the Gnosis and the teachings of Jesus in the Thomas Gospel, the teachings of Parmenides, Plotinus, Gaudapada, Abinavagupta, Meister Eckhart, Ramana Maharshi, Atmananda Krishna Menon, Ananda Mai and many others.</p><p></p><h2>Questions of Modern Chess Theory (Chess Classics)</h2><p><p>Questions of Modern Chess Theory is the lost masterpiece of Soviet chess literature.

"Attorney Jefferson McClintock from Charleston calling on line one. Says it's personal."<br> <br> "I'll take it."<br> <br> Renny shut the door of the windowless office he had occupied since graduating from law school three months earlier. If he continued working sixty hours a week, he had a fifty-fifty chance of a comfortable six-figure salary and an office with a view of the city in approximately twelve years. But for now he was at the bottom of the legal food chain. Of the 104 lawyers employed by Jackson, Robinson, and Temples in Charlotte, Raleigh, Winston-Salem, and Washington, D.C., his name, Josiah Fletchall Jacobson, was next to last on the firm's letterhead.<br> <br> Renny picked up the phone. "Hello, Mr. McClintock."<br> <br> "How are you, Renny?"<br> <br> "I'm OK. Busy learning the ins and outs of Truth in Lending and Regulation Z."<br> <br> "Bank work, eh?"<br> <br> "Yes sir. I have to review all the forms used by the lending institutions we represent to make sure they contain the exact wording required by the regulations and print everything in the appropriate size type."<br> <br> "Sounds picky."<br> <br> "It is, but if I make a mistake, the banks can get hit with class-action lawsuits involving thousands of consumers who have a cause of action, even if they didn't suffer any financial harm."<br> <br> "Our government regulators at work." The Charleston lawyer coughed and cleared his throat. "Well, move the law books to the side for a minute, and let's talk about your father's estate. With the help of two associates, I've almost completed the documents needed to probate your father's will, but there are several matters that need your attention."<br> <br> Two associates. Renny knew how the system worked. Multi-lawyer involvement was McClintock's way to triple his money: charge for each junior lawyer's time and throw in another fee at time and a half for the senior partner to proofread a stack of papers.<br> <br> "Any problems?" Renny asked.<br> <br> "We need to meet and discuss some things," McClintock answered vaguely. "When can you come to Charleston? Tomorrow is Friday. Why not leave early and see me around two?"<br> <br> Renny had worked until ten o'clock two nights earlier in the week and had billed enough hours for the week to sneak away by late morning on Friday. Besides, he wasn't going to let anything delay moving forward on the estate. "Could we make it three?"<br> <br> "Let me see." McClintock paused. "Yes. I can move my three o'clock appointment up an hour."<br> <br> "Do I need to bring anything?"<br> <br> "No," replied McClintock, "we'll have the paperwork ready. See you then."<br> <br> "With your bill on top," Renny remarked as he heard the click of the other lawyer hanging up the phone.<br> <br> Renny let his mind wander as he looked around his office. Even though it wasn't much larger than a walk-in closet, Renny didn't complain. Landing a job at a big law firm in a major city was the ultimate prize for the masses of eager students passing through the law school meat grinder. Each one entered the legal education process hoping they would come out with Law Review on their r�sum�s and filet mignon status in the difficult job market. Most ended up as hamburger, relieved to find any job at all.<br> <br> Renny had an advantage. Although not on Law Review or in the top 10 percent of his class, he had something even better: connections. For once, really the first time he could remember, his father had come to his aid. Dwight Temples, one of the senior partners in the firm, had attended college with Renny's father at The Citadel in Charleston. Over the years they maintained a casual friendship centered around an annual deep-sea fishing expedition off the coast of North Carolina. When Renny mentioned an interest in working for the firm's Charlotte office, H. L. Jacobson called Dwight Temples, and the interview with the hiring partner at Jackson, Robinson, and Temples became a formality. Renny was offered a position on the spot.<br> <br> Today was not the first call Renny had received from Jefferson McClintock, his family's lawyer in Charleston. Six weeks before, McClintock telephoned Renny with the news of H. L.'s sudden death on a golf course in Charleston. No warning. No cholesterol problem. No hypertension. No previous chest pains. The elder Jacobson was playing a round of golf with two longtime friends, Chaz Bentley, his stockbroker, and Alex Souther, a College of Charleston alumnus and restaurant owner.<br> <br> At the funeral home, Bentley, a jovial fellow and everyday golfer who probably received more stock market advice from Renny's father than he gave to him, had pumped Renny's hand and shook his head in disbelief. "I don't understand it. He was fine. No complaints of pain or dizziness. We were having a great round at the old Isle of Palms course. You should have seen the shot he hit from the championship tee on the seventh hole. You remember, it's the hole with the double water hazards. His tee shot must have gone 225 yards, straight down the fairway. He birdied the hole. Can you believe it? Birdied the last hole he ever played!" The stockbroker made it sound like nirvana to make a birdie then die on the golf course. "We were teeing off on number eight. Alex had taken a mulligan on his first shot and hooked his second try into a fairway bunker. I hit a solid drive just a little left of center." Renny could tell Bentley was enjoying Souther's duff and his own good shot all over again. "Then your father leaned over to tee up his ball and, he, uh...never got his ball on the tee," he finished lamely.<br> <br> Because of the circumstances of his death, the coroner had required an autopsy. The pathologist's report concluded death by coronary failure. H. L.'s family doctor, James Watson, had explained to Renny, "Your father's heart exploded. He never knew what happened. Death was instantaneous. The pathologist called me from the hospital after he examined the body and reviewed his findings with me. Given your father's good health, we were both puzzled at the severe damage to the heart muscle. We know how he died, but not why it happened as it did."<br> <br> Renny grieved, but he and his father had not had a close relationship. H. L. was a harsh, critical parent whose favor eluded his son like the proverbial carrot on a stick. Renny tried to please, but the elder Jacobson often changed the rules, and Renny discovered a new way to fail instead. After his mother's death, Renny only visited his father a couple of times a year.<br> <br> Since there was no one else with whom to share the considerable assets his father had inherited and then increased through savvy investments, Renny looked forward to the trip to Charleston. Once the estate was settled, he would become what some people called "independently wealthy." It had a nice ring to it, and Renny indulged in fantasies of future expenditures.<br> <br> H. L. was not a generous parent; he paid for Renny's education but never provided the extras he could have easily afforded. After landing the job at Jackson, Robinson, and Temples, Renny sold his old car for three thousand dollars and bought a new charcoal gray Porsche Boxster convertible. The payment and insurance on the new car devoured almost half of Renny's monthly paycheck, but the sporty vehicle was a sign to himself and, subconsciously, to his father, that he had started up the ladder of success. Now he would be able to pay off the car, buy a house, perhaps even quit work and duplicate his father's exploits in the commercial real estate market. His stay at the bottom of the law firm letterhead might be very short indeed.<br> <br> ~~~<br> <br> At 2:55 the next afternoon Renny was standing on the hot, humid Charleston sidewalk in front of the semicircular double stairway beckoning him with open arms to the law firm of McClintock and Carney, Esquires. Some antebellum grande dame must be spinning in her grave, he thought. Her house, her home, the common thread of the domestic and social fabric of her life, taken over by legal scriveners and secretaries with word processors and fax machines. It was not an uncommon fate for a growing number of the homes and mansions lining Fourth Street. An antique dealer rented Renny's ancestral home, near the Battery.<br> <br> At least Jefferson McClintock had Charleston roots. He wasn't a New York lawyer who came south for the Spoleto festival, unpacked his carpetbag, and hung out a legal shingle. In fact, few current Charlestonians went further back to the city's origins. McClintock's great-great-grandfather, a Scottish blacksmith's servant, could have been the farrier who made sure the grande dame's horses had proper footwear. Now the servant's descendant had his desk in the parlor and law books in the living room.<br> <br> When McClintock and his law partner, John Carney, purchased the house, they spent the money necessary to maintain the historic and architectural integrity of the 150-year-old structure. They had cleaned the white marble double stairway leading up from the street to the main entrance and made sure the hand railings were kept in good condition by a yearly staining to erase the corrosive effect of Charleston's proximity to the ocean. The exterior stucco had been painted a fresh light peach-only in Charleston could pastel houses reflect good taste. From a low-flying plane, the old residential district looked like a summer fruit compote.<br> <br> Opening the large front door, he stepped into the law firm's waiting area. As with many large nineteenth-century homes, the foyer was as wide and spacious as the dining room in a modern house plan. McClintock and Carney had turned the greeting area into a gracious reception room, furnishing it with antiques and quality reproductions.<br> <br> "Good afternoon, Mr. Jacobson," a cheerful receptionist spoke before Renny could give his name. "Mr. McClintock will be with you in a minute."<br> <br> Noticing a graduati...</p><h2>Kingdom Agenda: Living Life God&#x2019;s Way - Member Book</h2><p>The Christian message, when communicated from a comprehensive Kingdom perspective, provides an agenda that can stand next to and above all other attempts to define the meaning of life, whether for the individual, the family, the church, or the nation.</p><p><p>God&#x2019;s kingdom isn&#x2019;t just about theology and church.

Editor Ciuraru includes classics, such as Alexander Pope's sardonic epigraph "I am his Highness' dog at Kew; / Pray tell me, sir, whose dog are you," beside new works, such as Jill Ciment's witty parody of Sylvia Plath ("I begin to talk like a dog / I think I may well be a dog") and Jane Kenyon's tender "After an Illness, Walking the Dog" ("Wet things smell stronger, / and I suppose his main regret is that / he can sniff just one at a time"). Shakespeare and Kipling, Stevie Smith and Robin Becker--dozens of poets reflect on the joys and sorrows of living with dogs. The section on "The Virtues of Particular Breeds," in which homage is paid St. Bernards, Pomeranians, Irish setters, greyhounds, and other breeds, is especially satisfying. <i>Patricia Monaghan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Why do so many companies fail to implement the experience and insight they&#39;ve worked so hard to acquire? The Knowing-Doing Gap is the first book to confront the challenge of turning knowledge about how to improve performance into actions that produce measurable results. Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert Sutton, well-known authors and teachers, identify the causes of the knowing-doing gap and explain how to close it. The message is clear--firms that turn knowledge into action avoid the &#34;smart talk trap.&#34; Executives must use plans, analysis, meetings, and presentations to inspire deeds, not as substitutes for action. Companies that act on their knowledge also eliminate fear, abolish destructive internal competition, measure what matters, and promote leaders who understand the work people do in their firms. The authors use examples from dozens of firms that show how some overcome the knowing-doing gap, why others try but fail, and how still others avoid the gap in the first place. The Knowing-Doing Gap is sure to resonate with executives everywhere who struggle daily to make their firms both know and do what they know. It is a refreshingly candid, useful, and realistic guide for improving performance in today&#39;s business.</p><p>Every year, companies spend billions of dollars on training programs and management consultants, searching for ways to improve. But it's mostly all talk and no action, according to Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert I. Sutton, authors of <i>The Knowing-Doing Gap</i>. "Did you ever wonder why so much education and training, management consultation, organizational research and so many books and articles produce so few changes in actual management practice?" ask Stanford University professors Pfeffer and Sutton. "We wondered, too, and so we embarked on a quest to explore one of the great mysteries in organizational management: why knowledge of what needs to be done frequently fails to result in action or behavior consistent with that knowledge." The authors describe the most common obstacles to action---such as fear and inertia---and profile successful companies that overcome them.<p> Among the companies that Pfeffer and Sutton say do it right: General Electric, the Men's Wearhouse, SAS Institute, Southwest Airlines, Toyota, and British Petroleum. The book, based on four years of research, is broken into chapters with titles such as "When Talk Substitutes for Action," "When Fear Prevents Acting on Knowledge," "When Internal Competition Turns Friends into Enemies," and "Turning Knowledge into Action." Each chapter contains tips on what to do and what to avoid, and provides examples of how a lethargic company culture can be transformed. <i>The Knowing-Doing Gap</i> is a useful how-to guide for managers looking to make changes. Yet, as Pfeffer and Sutton point out, it takes more than reading their book or discussing their recommendations. It takes action. <i>--Dan Ring</i></p>"<b>The Knowing-Doing Gap</b> is must reading for us all. Why don't organizations do more of what they already know they should do? The answer isn't lack of smarts or strategy. Pfeffer and Sutton's analysis of the companies who get it right is fascinating and right on the money. Now...will we take action?"<br>--Bob Waterman, Co-author of In Search of Excellence and Author of What America Does Right<p> "The Internet economy is not simply an evolution in technology-it's a revolution. <b>The Knowing-Doing Gap</b> will help businesspeople apply their expertise in ways that are well suited for succeeding in this new economy."<br>--John Chambers, President and CEO, Cisco Systems, Inc.</p><p> "Finally, a book that provides valuable insight into the question, Why do most companies know what to do but so few actually do it? It's not so much about strategy, explain the authors; it's all about execution. Thank you, Pfeffer and Sutton!"<br>--Richard M. Kovacevich, President and Chief Executive Officer, Wells Fargo &amp; Company</p><p> "<b>The Knowing-Doing Gap</b> reveals the major obstacles to action that confront people in organizations-from CEOs to entry-level professionals. The authors guide practitioners through the labyrinth of organizational roadblocks and help them turn knowledge into action."<br>--Deborah Coleman, CEO, Merix Corporation</p><p> "Pfeffer and Sutton expose the real reasons businesses fail to compete successfully.

The theme is shame and shamelessness, born from the violence which is modern history. Revelation and obscurity, affairs of honour, blushings of all parts, the recession of erotic life, the open violence of public life, create the extraordinary Rushdie mood." -- Malcolm Bradbury, <i>The Guardian</i> <br> <br>"A pitch black comedy of public life and historical imperatives." -- <i>The Times</i>In this brilliant novel, Salman Rushdie masterfully combines history, art, language, politics, and religion. Set in a country "not quite Pakistan," the story centers around the families of two men -- one a celebrated warrior, the other, a debauched playboy engaged in a protracted duel that is played out in the political landscape of their country. <b>Shame</b> is a tour de force and a fitting predecessor to the author's legendary novel, <b>The Satanic Verses</b>.</p><h2>Near the Exit: Travels with the Not-So-Grim Reaper</h2><p><p><strong>"An ideal guidebook to facing the inevitable." &#x2014;<em>Foreword Reviews </em></strong></p> <p>After her brother died unexpectedly and her mother moved into a dementia-care facility, spiritual travel writer and Episcopal deacon Lori Erickson felt called to a new quest: to face death head on, with the eye of a tourist and the heart of a pastor. Blending memoir, spirituality, and travel, <em>Near the Exit</em> examines how cultures confront and have confronted death, from Egypt&#x2019;s Valley of the Kings and Mayan temples, to a Colorado cremation pyre and Day of the Dead celebrations, to Maori settlements and tourist-destination graveyards. Erickson reflects on mortality&#x2014;the ways we avoid it, the ways we cope with it, and the ways life is made more precious by accepting it&#x2014;in places as far away as New Zealand and as close as the nursing home up the street. Throughout her personal journey and her travels, Erickson helps us to see that one of the most life-affirming things we can do is to invite death along for the ride.</p></p><p><p><strong>Lori Erickson</strong> is one of America&#x2019;s top travel writers specializing in spiritual journeys and is an Episcopal deacon. She&#x2019;s the author of the memoir <em>Holy Rover: Journeys in Search of Mystery, Miracles, and God</em>, which was a finalist for the 2017 Travel Book of the Year INDIES Award from <em>Foreword Reviews</em>. She lives in Iowa City, Iowa, with her husband.</p><p>"A helpful reminder that no one escapes this life alive, Lori Erickson&#x2019;s <em>Near the Exit </em>is a travel text and an act of religious exploration, presenting spiritual meditations from some of the holiest places on Earth....Showing how coping mechanisms and spiritual practices from around the world can be valuable for learning more about our own lives and eventual deaths, <em>Near the Exit</em> is an ideal guidebook to facing the inevitable with religious or spiritual perspective." &#x2014;<em>Foreword Reviews </em></p><br><br><p>"This book&#x2019;s journey to spiritual places near and far is worth taking." <br>&#x2014;<em>Library Journal</em>, starred review</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Open-hearted and soulful, never morbid, and often uplifting, <em>Near the Exit</em> is a colorful travelogue of mortality. I&#x2019;ve read many books on illness and dying; few have made me smile as often and see the uniquely human richness of the final chapters of life.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Ira Byock, author of <em>Dying Well</em> and <em>The Best Care Possible</em> and Active Emeritus Professor of Medicine, the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Near the Exit</em> is a delicious, funny, and quite moving read. Part <em>actual</em> travelogue, it&#x2019;s also a <em>spiritual</em> exploration of death. The writing is stellar; the reflections on the unexpected nature of grief and the way Lori Erickson plumbs &#x2018;seeming coincidence&#x2019; grabbed my attention and didn&#x2019;t let it go. Highly recommend for people of any or no faith practice.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Jennifer Grant, author of <em>Love You More</em> and <em>Maybe I Can Love My Neighbor Too</em></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Erickson is our expert tour guide as she takes us on a colorful journey of the world&#x2019;s sacred death rituals and destinations. Her vivid prose is our companion and invitation to the spiritual packing we needn&#x2019;t delay until the night before departure.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;J. Dana Trent, author of <em>Dessert First: Preparing for Death While Savoring Life</em></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<em>Near the Exit</em> is not a typical book on death and dying from a Christian perspective. It is an intriguing exploration of late life and death that will sometimes cause you to squirm or to laugh out loud. Always though, it will prompt you to think deeply about what it is to be mortal. Author Lori Erikson fearlessly weaves ancient perspectives and cultural expressions about death gleaned from her own travel experiences into the intimate stories of her mother&#x2019;s life in a nursing home in Iowa. <em>Near the Exit</em> will appeal to anyone who struggles to understand the mystery of death and dying.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Missy Buchanan, advocate, writer, and speaker for older adults</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;What happens when a gifted travel writer combines her interests in travel, religion, and death? The result is a fascinating book called <em>Near the Exit</em>, with trips to Rome, a Day of the Dead celebration, pyramids in Egypt and Mexico, nursing homes, a Maori ceremony in New Zealand, a farm in Iowa, and more. Beautiful writing about a trip we all will someday take.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Brian D. McLaren, author and activist</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;When I first picked up <em>Near the Exit</em>, I found that, much to my relief, I had not commenced to read another grief book. Instead it&#x2019;s a travelogue that explores a wide range of sacred sites&#x2014;from the exotic (and musty) pyramids of Egypt&#x2019;s Valley of the Kings to the Iowa nursing home where Lori&#x2019;s elderly mother navigates the labyrinth of dementia&#x2014;all characterized by a light-hearted and curious inquiry about what death means in various cultural and spiritual contexts.</p><br><br><p>As one who has been hanging out with the Grim Reaper more than I care to lately, I took this book in like a breath of fresh air. I hope <em>Near the Exit</em> will help others navigate mortality as Lori Erickson meets us wherever we are and gently invites us on a guided global tour.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Kate Sheehan Roach, Director of Content, ContemplativeLife.org</p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Is it possible to become comfortable with the thought of one&#x2019;s own death? Lori Erickson sets out on a fantastic voyage to explore the answer, and, best of all, we get to go with her. From the depths of Egypt&#x2019;s Great Pyramids to the wide-open spiritual expanse that is Crestone, Colorado, <em>Near the Exit </em>shows us that it is possible not only to chart the landscape of mortality but also to make it gloriously our own. A hopeful and inspiring book.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Sophfronia Scott, author of <em>This Child of Faith: Raising a Spiritual Child in a Secular World</em></p></p><h2>Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand (Ayn Rand Library)</h2><p><b>THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION&#x2014;The definitive statement of Ayn Rand&#x2019;s philosophy as interpreted by her best student and chosen heir.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> This brilliantly conceived and organized book is Dr. Leonard Peikoff&#x2019;s classic text on the abstract principles and practical applications of Objectivism, based on his lecture series &#x201c;The Philosophy of Objectivism.&#x201d; Ayn Rand said of these lectures: &#x201c;Until or unless I write a comprehensive treatise on my philosophy, Dr. Peikoff&#x2019;s course is the only <i>authorized</i> presentation of the entire theoretical structure of Objectivism&#x2014;that is, the only one that I know of my knowledge to be fully accurate.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>Objectivism</i>, Peikoff covers every philosophic topic that Rand regarded as important&#x2014;from certainty to money, from logic to art, from measurement to sex. Drawn from Rand&#x2019;s published works as well as in-depth conversations between her and Peikoff, these chapters illuminate Objectivism&#x2014;and its creator&#x2014;with startling clarity. With <i>Objectivism,</i> the millions of readers who have been transformed by <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> and <i>The Fountainhead</i> will discover the full philosophical system underlying Ayn Rand&#x2019;s work.</p><p><b>Leonard Peikoff</b>&nbsp;is the preeminent Ayn Rand scholar writing today. He worked closely with Rand in New York City for thirty years and was designated by her as heir to her estate. He has taught philosophy at several places, including Hunter College and New York University. Dr. Peikoff is the author of&nbsp;<i>The DIM Hypothesis: Why the Lights of the West Are Going Out</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Cause of Hitler&#x2019;s Germany</i>. He grew up in Western Canada and now lives in Southern California. He also&nbsp;hosted the national radio talk show "Philosophy: Who Needs It."Peikoff, Rand's heir and authorized evangelist, tries to present the definitive apologetic for her individualist gospel. Libraries could certainly use a book explaining a writer whose works still sell half a million copies a year. But Rand's success is rooted in the unsubtle but dramatic Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged , not in tracts like Capitalism, the Unknown Ideal . And this book mostly summarizes those tracts. There are sophisticated defenses like those in Robert Nozick's Anarchy, State, and Utopia ( LJ 1/15/75) for some Rand doctrines, but Peikoff, as official expositor, is bound to the received word. Odd claims like, "monopolies achieved under capitalism . . . depend on merit and do no harm" abound. In pursuit of Randian orthodoxy, he must denounce leftists, but he goes further and holds that "historically, from the Sherman Act to Herbert Hoover to the Bush Administration, it is the conservatives, not the leftists, who have always been the major destroyers of the United States."-- Leslie Armour, Univ. of Ottawa<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>I Am Zion: Unleash the Power of God&#39;s Glory in Your Life</h2><p><b>Zion is not just a place in Israel.

Wasserstrom and Maura Elizabeth Cunningham provide cogent answers to urgent questions regarding the world's newest superpower and offer a framework for understanding China's meteoric rise from developing country to superpower. Framing their answers through the historical legacies - Confucian thought, Western and Japanese imperialism, the Mao era, and the Tiananmen Square massacre - that largely define China's present-day trajectory, Wasserstrom and Cunningham introduce readers to the Chinese Communist Party, the building boom in Shanghai, and the environmental fallout of rapid Chinese industrialization. They also explain unique aspects of Chinese culture, such as the one-child policy, and provide insight into Chinese-American relations, a subject that has become increasingly fraught during the Trump era. As Wasserstrom and Cunningham draw parallels between China and other industrialized nations during their periods of development, in particular the United States during its rapid industrialization in the 19th century, they also predict how we might expect China to act in the future vis-�-vis the United States, Russia, India, and its East Asian neighbors.<br><br>Updated to include perspectives on Hong Kong's shifting political status, as well as an expanded discussion of President Xi Jinping's time in office, <em>China in the 21st Century</em> provides a concise and insightful introduction to this significant global power.<br></p><p><p><b><em>WHAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW About This Series</em></b></p> <p><b>Who it's for:</b></p> <p> Busy people with diverse interests, ranging from college students to professionals, who wish to inform themselves in a succinct yet authoritative manner about a particular topic.</p> <p><b>What's inside:</b></p> <p>An incisive approach to a complex and timely issue, laid out in a straight-forward, question-and-answer format.</p> <p><b>Meet Our Authors</b></p> <p> Top experts in their given fields, ranging from an <i>Economist</i> correspondent to a director at the Council on Foreign Relations, you can trust our authors&#x2019; expertise and guidance.</p> <p><b>Popular Topics in the "<i>What Everyone Needs to Know</i>" Series</b></p> <ul> <li>International Politics</li> <li>Environmental Policies</li> <li>World History</li> <li>Sciences &amp; Math</li> <li>Religion &amp; Spirituality</li> </ul><br><strong>Jeffrey N.

It contains two relatively detailed case files, quite similar to the material a trial lawyer may have as he or she approaches trial. The first file is a murder case where the issue is the identity of the killer and the defendant is the estranged husband of the victim. The second file is a civil action for defamation brought by a former employee against her very wealthy employer. The cases raise realistic and challenging issues in the law of evidence and allow for a critical assessment of that law. They are followed by over three hundred problems for class analysis and discussion. These problems address the full range of evidentiary issues.</p></p><p></p><h2>Great Writing Foundations (Great Writing, Fifth Edition)</h2><p>The new edition of the Great Writing series provides clear explanations, extensive models of academic writing and practice to help learners write great sentences, paragraphs, and essays.

As Adam Smith put it, "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest." Capitalism works better than socialism, according to this thinking, only because we are not kind and generous enough to make socialism work. If we were saints, we would be socialists.</p> <p>In <i>Why Not Capitalism</i>?, Jason Brennan attacks this widely held belief, arguing that capitalism would remain the best system even if we were morally perfect.&nbsp;Even in an ideal world, private property and free markets would be the best way to promote mutual cooperation, social justice, harmony, and prosperity. Socialists seek to capture the moral high ground by showing that ideal socialism is morally superior to realistic capitalism. But, Brennan responds, ideal capitalism is superior to ideal socialism, and so capitalism beats socialism at every level. </p> <p>Clearly, engagingly, and at times provocatively written, <i>Why Not Capitalism? </i>will cause readers of all political persuasions to re-evaluate where they stand vis-�-vis economic priorities and systems&#x2015;as they exist now and as they might be improved in the future. </p></p><p><p>Jason Brennan is Assistant Professor of Strategy, Economics, Ethics, and Public Policy at Georgetown University. He is the author of <i>Compulsory Voting: For and Against</i>, with Lisa Hill, <i>Libertarianism: What Everyone Needs to Know, The Ethics of Voting, </i>and <i>A Brief History of Liberty</i>, with David Schmidtz.</p><p>"Are you interested in capitalism as a path to your personal utopia? This stirring moral defense of a free society is the place to start."</p><b> <p>&#x2015;Tyler Cowen, George Mason University</p></b> <p>"In forceful strokes, Jason Brennan attacks the work of the late G.A. Cohen's defense of socialism and neatly shows why and how it is not the best of all systems even in the best of all possible worlds, let alone the highly imperfect world in which we live. His combination of accessible prose with technical precision is a model of good writing on political theory that should enable this book to reach the wider audience it deserves."</p> <p><strong>&#x2015;Richard Epstein, New York University School of Law</strong></p> <p>"Gone is the false triumphalism of the 1990s. The question of how to organize society, and the ideological conflict between market systems and socialist systems, is live. Brennan offers in this brief volume a fully realized and compelling answer to Jerry Cohen's rightly celebrated book <em>Why Not Socialism?</em> Many of the responses to socialist advocacy dismiss command economies as impractical or impossible. But Brennan grants Cohen his premises, and carries out the argument in a way that faithfully mirrors the logic that Cohen tried to marshall in his defense of socialism. Brennan offers an unflinching defense of capitalism, and does it with style and humor. His writing is at once accessible to the first-time philosopher and yet persuasive to the denizens of the ivory towers. This book will be on the reading list for every class I teach."</p> <p><strong>&#x2015;Michael Munger, Director of Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, Duke University</strong></p> <p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Pearson Reviews &amp; Rationales: Maternal-Newborn Nursing with Nursing Reviews &amp; Rationales (Pearson Nursing Reviews &amp; Rationales)</h2><p><p> <i>NCLEX�-RN� exam preparation for nursing courses covering maternal-newborn nursing.<br> </i> <b> <br>A premier resource for NCLEX�-RN test prep &#x2013; now with Pearson Test Prep*<br> </b> <b> <i>Pearson Reviews &amp; Rationales: Maternal-Newborn Nursing</i> </b> has prepared thousands of students for success on the NCLEX-RN exam.

Given surprising leeway by her family for her increasingly erratic behaviour, she nevertheless feels ever more stifled and repressed. Motherhood, womanhood, the banality of love, the terrors of desire, the inexplicable brutality of &#x2018;another person carrying your heart forever&#x2019; &#x2013; <em>Die, My Love</em> faces all this with a raw intensity. It&#x2019;s not a question of <em>if</em> a breaking point will be reached, but rather <em>when</em> and how violent a form will it take?</p><p>This is a brutal, wild book &#x2013; it&#x2019;s impossible to come out from reading Ariana Harwicz unscathed. The language of <em>Die, My Love</em> cuts like a scalpel even as it attains a kind of cinematic splendour, evoking the likes of John Cassavetes, David Lynch, Lars von Trier and John Ford. In a text that explores the destabilising effects of passion and its absence, immersed in the psyche of a female protagonist always on the verge of madness, in the tradition of Sylvia Plath and Clarice Lispector, Harwicz moulds language, submitting it to her will in irreverent prose. Bruising and confrontational, yet anchored in an unapologetic beauty and lyricism, <em>Die, My Love</em> is a unique reading experience that quickly becomes addictive.</p><ul><li><p>Longlisted for <strong>Man Booker International Prize</strong> 2018</p></li><li><p>Shortlisted for the <strong>Republic of Consciousness Prize</strong> 2018</p></li><li><p>Shortlisted for the <strong>Internationaler Literaturpreis (Germany)</strong> 2019</p></li></ul></p><p><p>Compared to Nathalie Sarraute and Virginia Woolf, <b>Ariana Harwicz</b> is one of the most radical figures in contemporary Argentinian literature.

She has written two plays, which have been staged in Buenos Aires. <i>Die, My Love</i> is her first novel and the first instalment of an &#x2018;involuntary&#x2019; trilogy, followed by <i>Feebleminded</i> and <i>Precocious</i> (forthcoming). As well as receiving rave reviews, it has been adapted for the stage in Argentina and Israel. <i>Die, My Love</i> was longlisted for the Man Booker International Prize (2018) and shortlisted for the Republic of Consciousness Prize (2018).

Behind me, against the backdrop of a house somewhere between dilapidated and homely, I could hear the voices of my son and my husband. Both of them naked. Both of them splashing around in the blue paddling pool, the water thirty-five degrees. It was the Sunday before a bank holiday. I was a few steps away, hidden in the underbrush. Spying on them. How could a weak, perverse woman like me, someone who dreams of a knife in her hand, be the mother and wife of those two individuals? What was I going to do? I burrowed deeper into the ground, hiding my body. I wasn&#x2019;t going to kill them. I dropped the knife and went to hang out the washing like nothing had happened. I carefully pegged the socks to the line, my baby&#x2019;s and my man&#x2019;s. Their underwear and shirts. I looked at myself and saw an ignorant country bumpkin hanging out the laundry and drying her hands on her skirt before returning to the kitchen. They had no idea. Hanging out the clothes had been a success. I lay back down among the tree trunks. They&#x2019;re already chopping wood for the cold season. People here prepare for winter like animals. Nothing distinguishes us from them. Take me, an educated woman, a university graduate &#x2013; I&#x2019;m more of an animal than those half-dead foxes, their faces stained red, sticks propping their mouths wide open. My neighbour Frank a few miles away, the oldest of seven siblings, fired a shotgun into his own arse last Christmas. What a nice surprise it must have been for his pack of kids. But the guy was just following tradition. Suicide by shotgun for his great-great-grandfather, great-grandfather, grandfather and father. At the very least, you could say it was his turn. And me? A normal woman from a normal family, but an eccentric, a deviant, the mother of one child and with another, though who knows at this point, on its way. I slowly slide a hand into my knickers. And to think I&#x2019;m the person in charge of my son&#x2019;s education. My husband calls me over for a beer under the pergola, asks, Blonde or dark? The baby appears to have shat himself and I&#x2019;ve got to go and buy his cake. I bet other mothers would bake one themselves. Six months, apparently it&#x2019;s not the same as five or seven. Whenever I look at him I think of my husband behind me, about to ejaculate on my back, but instead turning me over suddenly and coming inside me. If this hadn&#x2019;t happened, if I&#x2019;d closed my legs, if I&#x2019;d grabbed his dick, I wouldn&#x2019;t have to go to the bakery for cream cake or chocolate cake and candles, half a year already. The moment other women give birth they usually say, I can&#x2019;t imagine my life without him now, it&#x2019;s as though he&#x2019;s always been here. Pfff. I&#x2019;m coming, baby! I want to scream, but I sink deeper into the cracked earth. I want to snarl, to howl, but instead I let the mosquitoes bite me, let them savour my sweetened skin. The sun deflects the silvery reflection of the knife back to me and I&#x2019;m blinded. The sky is red, violet, trembling. I hear them looking for me, the filthy baby and the naked husband. Ma-ma, da-da, poo-poo. My baby&#x2019;s the one who does the talking, all night long. Co-co-na-na-ba-ba. There they are. I leave the knife in the scorched pasture, hoping that when I find it next it&#x2019;ll look like a scalpel, a feather, a pin. I get up, hot and bothered by the tingling between my legs. Blonde or dark? Whatever you&#x2019;re having, my love. We&#x2019;re one of those couples who mechanise the word &#x2018;love&#x2019;, who use it even when they despise each other. I never want to see you again, my love. I&#x2019;m coming, I say, and I&#x2019;m a fraud of a country woman with a red polka-dot skirt and split ends. I&#x2019;ll have a blonde beer, I say in my foreign accent. I&#x2019;m a woman who&#x2019;s let herself go, has a mouth full of cavities and no longer reads. Read, you idiot, I tell myself, read one full sentence from start to finish. Here we are, all three of us together for a family portrait. We toast the happiness of our baby and drink the beers, my son in his high chair chewing on a leaf. I put a finger in his mouth and he shrieks, biting me with his gums. My husband wants to plant a tree for the baby&#x2019;s long life and I don&#x2019;t know what to say, I just smile like a fool. Does he have any idea? So many healthy and beautiful women in the area, and he ended up falling for me. A nutcase. A foreigner. Someone beyond repair. Muggy out today, isn&#x2019;t it? Seems it&#x2019;ll last a while, he says. I take long swigs from the bottle, breathing through my nose and wishing, quite simply, that I were dead.</p></p><h2>St. Pius X : The Farm Boy Who Became Pope</h2><p>Another stirring tale from the Vision Books series for youth 9-15 years, this book tells the charming story of Giuseppe Sarto, "the farm boy who became Pope". Young readers will be inspired by the life of this holy man--from his youthful days of hard work and prayer to receive the education he needed; to his years as country priest, encouraging his people to holiness; through the steady promotions to pastor, monsignor, bishop, cardinal, and archbishop, which he reluctantly accepted but in which he always became the beloved of those he served; to his days as the Holy Pontiff, Pope Pius X, the only canonized Pope of this century. This simple man who never forgot the poor will always be a timely example of holiness.<p>Born of very humble circumstances, young Giuseppe Sarto had one burning desire while growing up on a farm--to become a priest. But never did he or his generous parents ever dream that he would one day sit in the Chair of St. Peter. This is the inspiring story of the humble "Pope of little children," whose love for Christ and children moved him to change the requirements for First Communion so that young children as early as 7 years old could receive the Holy Eucharist.</p></p><p>Text: English<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The Claiming: Book Three of The Circle of Ceridwen Saga</h2><p><p><b>Book Three of the thrilling English Adventure loved by over 100,000 readers in 125 countries...</b></p><p><b><i>How long can you fight Fate?

Exploring key anarchist ideas of society and the state, freedom and equality, authority and power, the record investigates the successes and failures of anarchist movements throughout the world. Presenting a balanced and critical survey, the detailed document covers not only classic anarchist thinkers&#x2014;such as Godwin, Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin, Reclus, and Emma Goldman&#x2014;but also other libertarian figures, such as Nietzsche, Camus, Gandhi, Foucault, and Chomsky. Essential reading for anyone wishing to understand what anarchists stand for and what they have achieved, this fascinating account also includes an epilogue that examines the most recent developments, including postanarchism and anarcho-primitivism as well as the anarchist contributions to the peace, green, and global justice movements of the 21st century.</p></p><p><strong>Peter Marshall is a philosopher, a historian, a poet, and the author of 15 books, including <i>Nature's Web: Rethinking Our Place on Earth</i>.<br></strong>The goal of an egalitarian, communal society has always united Marxists and leftist socialists, some of the latter (often if not always described as anarchists) refusing any truck with centralized power At various times, such ideas have found relatively wide appeal, and this era is one&#x2014;expressed for instance in the antiglobalization movement's emphases on local control and direct democracy&#x2014;making Marshall's comprehensive treatment a timely read. Newly revised and updated, this indispensable history of social libertarian thought now reaches into the 21st century&#x2014;touching upon themes echoed in other recent titles, including Raj Patel's <i>The Value of Nothing</i>. Marshall casts a wide net, gathering all traces of antiauthoritarian socialist thought in works from Lao Tzu through Noam Chomsky, social ecology, and the Zapatistas. Readers will be repeatedly rewarded by Marshall's judiciousness and close readings of both the great names in anarchist history&#x2014;Proudhon, Kropotkin, and Tolstoy&#x2014;and less expected contributors&#x2014;Rousseau, Swift, and Burke. Blowing away cobwebs of misunderstanding and misrepresentation, this is a stimulating portrait of a highly varied but distinctive political ideal, tradition, and practice arising from the enduring human impulse to be free. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Reich, former Secretary of Labor and author of Beyond Outrage). Voters cast their ballots for what they believe is right, for the things that make moral sense. Yet Democrats have too often failed to use language linking their moral values with their policies. The Little Blue Book demonstrates how to make that connection clearly and forcefully, with hands-on advice for discussing the most pressing issues of our time: the economy, health care, women&#39;s issues, energy and environmental policy, education, food policy, and more. Dissecting the ways thatextreme conservative positions have permeated political discourse, Lakoff and Wehling show how to fight back on moral grounds and in concrete terms.

And today our politics is governed by two very different views of what is right and wrong.<br> <br>The progressive view, mostly in the Democratic Party, is that democracy depends on citizens caring about each other and taking responsibility both for themselves and for others. This yields a view of government with a moral mission: to protect and empower all citizens equally. The mechanism for accomplishing this mission is through what we call the Public, a system of public resources necessary for a decent private life and a robust private enterprise: roads and bridges, education, health care, communication systems, court systems, basic research, police and the military, a fair judicial system, clean water and air, safe food, parks, and much more.<br> <br>Conservatives hold the opposite view: that democracy exists to provide citizens with the maximum <i>liberty</i> to pursue their self-interest with little or no commitment to the interests of others. Under this view, there should be as little of the Public as possible. Instead, as much as possible should be relegated to what we call the Private. The Private is comprised of individuals (private life), businesses owned by them (private enterprise), and institutions set up by groups of individuals (private clubs and associations). The Private is, for conservatives, a moral ideal, sacrosanct, where no government can tread, whether to help or hinder, regulate, or even monitor. No one should have to pay for anyone else. Private interests should rule, even if that means that corporate interests, the most powerful of private interests, govern our lives through a laissez-faire free market. Citizens are free to sink or swim on their own.<br> <br>Each moral worldview comes with a set of issue frames. By <i>frames</i>, we mean structures of ideas that we use to understand the world. Because all <i>politics</i> is morally framed, all <i>policy</i> is also morally framed, and thus the choice of any particular policy frame is a moral choice. Americans are now faced with two sets of moral choices, each leading the nation in opposite directions. Nowhere is this clearer than in the issue of health care, so let us look at this example in some detail.<br> <br>Rudolph Giuliani, in his 2008 run for the presidency, likened health care to a product, using the example of a flat-screen TV. Not everyone, he argued, deserves a flat-screen TV. If you want one, work for it and save up for it. Similarly not everyone deserves health care, but you should be free to buy it if you want it. Like a flat-screen TV, health care is in this view a <i>product</i>. If you want a product, you can make the money for it and buy it, and if you can&#x2019;t afford it, too bad. But if you don&#x2019;t want a product, no one, especially not the government, should be able to force you to buy it. That should be unconstitutional&#x2014;outside the powers of the government.<br> <br>The problem, of course, is that this is a metaphor. Health care is not literally a product built in a factory and transferred physically from a seller to a buyer. It cannot be crated and shipped. You cannot return defective health care and get a refund. Yet the metaphor of health care as a product survived the presidential campaign and was even adopted by the Democrats.<br> <br>Giuliani introduced his TV metaphor in the spring of 2008, but after the election that fall, Barack Obama, a former professor of constitutional law, used the same metaphor while reasoning to a different conclusion. In formulating his health care act, President Obama placed the product metaphor in the context of the commerce clause of the Constitution, Article I, Section 8, which gives Congress the right to regulate commerce. If health care is a product that is bought and sold across state lines, then Congress can regulate the selling and buying of it. The Affordable Care Act is based on that metaphor and Obama&#x2019;s interpretation of it.<br> <br>What that did was impose a frame on health care&#x2014;a frame from the market economy. Notice what is not in the frame: if health care is a product, it is not a right. Providing health care is thus not a moral concern; it is an economic matter. The word <i>affordable</i> fits the economic frame, as do words like <i>market, purchase</i>, and <i>choice</i>.<br> <br>Obama seemingly did not even consider a Medicare-for-all model of national health care. Medicare involves a tax, and conservatives had vowed not to raise any taxes, seeing them as the process by which the government takes people&#x2019;s hard-earned money and wastes it. Obama also did not think he could replace the powerful private health care industry, so he chose to work with it. Doing so, however, would require regulating it, and the most straightforward constitutional basis for congressional regulation is the commerce clause. This meant that health care had to be framed in terms of the market.<br> <br>Economists have long observed that there is an economic equivalence between a tax and a required purchase. The equivalence lies in the concept of fungibility. In any business balance sheet, the loss of a credit (e.g., a tax paid) is equivalent to the gain of a debit (a purchase required). That all occurs within an economic frame, where economics is all that is considered.<br> <br>Conceptually, however, a tax is normally understood in terms of a frame very different from a necessary purchase. Purchasing is in what we can call the commercial-event frame of buying and selling products, while what the government does is a credit-debit exchange and is necessarily in the taxation frame.<br> <br>From a conservative perspective, nearly all taxation is governmental oppression, and therefore immoral, but <i>purchasing</i> is perfectly fine because it is based in the market, and conservatives have a moral preference for the market. Obama, hoping to avoid conservative opposition to taxation and needing a basis for regulation, chose to use the power of the commerce clause, which required the &#x201c;health care is a product&#x201d; metaphor. The metaphor was, as usual, taken literally.<br> <br>At first, Obama favored the public option, in which the government would be seen as a business competing with other businesses and selling health care at a lower price with better offerings. Medicare, run by the government, has only a 3 percent administration cost, while most health care corporations have administrative costs between 15 and 20 percent, mostly to verify and seek grounds to deny claims. Adding in profit demands, private health care spends about 30 percent of its total budget not on care but on administration and profit. This is a large part of what makes the U.S. health care system the most expensive in the world, though far from the best. The public option did not require a large, expensive staff to administer, and possibly deny, claims, nor did it have to make a profit. The government could have used the savings from administration, profit, and advertising to cover everyone.<br> <br>Crucially, however, in the public option, the metaphor of health care as a product was preserved, and conservatives objected that the public option would result in unfair competition. Given the market frame, this was a position easy to argue for, and conservatives eventually prevailed, forcing the president to abandon the public option. With the public option defeated, the president reframed. He went with a plan he took to be more favored by conservatives: the individual mandate, backed by Hilary Clinton and Mitt Romney and proposed originally by the conservative Heritage Foundation. What the Heritage Foundation and Romney liked about the individual mandate was that it forced everyone to buy insurance, thus giving the insurance companies tens of millions more customers and more profits. This version of health care was passed into law.<br> <br>Conservatives never argued against any of the law&#x2019;s specific provisions. For example, they never said that there should be preconditions or caps. Instead they reframed. They made a moral case against &#x201c;Obamacare.&#x201d; (In choosing this name, they made Obama the issue, not the people and their health.) The conservative moral principles applied were freedom and life, and they had language to go with them. Freedom was imperiled by &#x201c;government takeover,&#x201d; life by &#x201c;death panels.&#x201d; Republicans at all levels repeated this language over and over, changed public discourse, and thus changed the minds of the electorate, especially the independents. By 2010 <i>Obamacare</i> had become a dirty word, and the most radical Republicans won their elections and took over the House with a promise to repeal it.<br> <br>What the Obama administration missed was the opportunity to argue on the basis of the same moral ideals of freedom and life. Serious illness without health care takes away your liberty and threatens your life. Forcing people to live without health care is an infringement on their liberty. But the White House did not choose to frame the issue with that moral counterargument; instead they discussed technical policy details.<br> <br>Conservatives, meanwhile, were arguing their values. People should not be forced to pay for other people&#x2019;s goods. The Public should be kept to a minimum. And the individual mandate constitutes a government takeover: if the government can force people to buy particular products, it can force them to do anything at all. Liberty is imperiled.<br> <br>In all of this, the Obama administration&#x2019;s rationale inadvertently helped its opponents by adopting the product metaphor and placing health care in a market context.<br> <br>In 2012 the Roberts Supreme Court took up the conservative frame. The conservative justices, taking the product metaphor literally, again argued that the individual mandate forces people to buy a particular product: health care. If the government can do that, it can force you to buy burial plots or cell phones or even broccoli! The government would no longer be regulating commerce but bringing it into existence. Citizens would be forced to pay for other people, thus denying individual liberty. The result would be a &#x201c;government takeover.&#x201d;<br> <br>At this writing the Court has not yet decided, but one can see where this is going. Medicare and Social Security are likely next in line, as is environmental legislation, which serves the public interest over the private and thus threatens the use of private property. At stake is the very idea of the Public. At stake is the view of democracy as a system in which citizens are bound to fellow citizens, with each individual bearing social as well as personal responsibility.<br> <br>This state of affairs should never have come to pass. Health care should never have been a market issue. The Constitution gives Congress the right to &#x201c;provide for the... general welfare of the United States.&#x201d; That right should have been, and should be, the moral and conceptual basis of health care law. But because it was not, because the issue was placed within a market frame, the general welfare of the United States is in danger. Do we care about each other? Are we proud that we have contributed to the liver transplants of those who need them? Are we proud to save the lives of our fellow Americans on a daily basis? Will we recognize that, without the Public, we have no reasonable private lives or private enterprise? And will we recognize that the dismantling of the Public exposes us to corporate control over our lives&#x2014;not for our well-being but for corporate profit, and not under the control of a government we elect and can change but under the control of corporate managers we did not elect and cannot change?<br> <br>We are writing this book because the centrality of this issue is not now in public discourse, and we hope the Democratic Party and its candidates bring it to the fore. To do so, they need to use language appropriate to the moral views they believe in.<br> <br>Language is not a matter of &#x201c;mere words&#x201d; or wordsmithing. Words mean things. They are defined by conceptual frames. In politics those frames are morally based. They are the same morally based frames that underlie&#x2014;and precede&#x2014;our policies. To discuss political language is to discuss morality and policy.<br> <br>This fundamental truth contradicts a long-standing myth about political communication, a myth that comes from the advertising world. The word <i>messaging</i> is defined in terms of that myth, namely, that morality and policy are independent of messaging. In this myth messaging is just wordsmithing, finding the &#x201c;words that work&#x201d; to sell the policy, conceptualized as a product being marketed.<br> <br>There are two problems with this idea. First, communication and policy are based on the same moral frames. Policy doesn&#x2019;t come first, followed by communication, as the health care example shows. Second, the messaging myth is fundamentally undemocratic, placing politics in a business marketing frame, where any marketing that &#x201c;sells&#x201d; is sanctioned and preferred. In this view, citizens are consumers of politics, and politicians are looking for ways to &#x201c;sell&#x201d; them ideas. This is in direct contradiction with the Democratic understanding of how democracy should work, a view that is shared by most Americans.<br> <br>Our alternative is communication based on moral and conceptual transparency. Know your values and say what you believe. Will this work? It depends on how well it is done. Moreover we believe that most Americans care about their fellow citizens. That is the moral basis of Democratic thought, and we think the public will respond to it.<br> <br>Finally, a caveat. This book is not intended to be exhaustive. It&#x2019;s too short, and a book much bigger would probably be too long. We will cover a great deal but far from the full range of topics. We jump in with the most pressing challenges facing Democrats and with hands-on communication advice. Next, we explore the effects, especially the hidden effects, of extreme conservatism. Third, we turn to ideas that Democrats need but that are not yet in public discourse, along with the new language needed to express those ideas. Finally, our &#x201c;Phrasebook for Democrats&#x201d; covers the most controversial areas in current politics, providing relevant background and introducing new ways to talk.<br> <br>Our job here is to go beyond policy and punditry and the same old ideas. We hope it will change the way you see, understand, and discuss American politics.</p><h2>Mount Pleasant: A Novel</h2><p><p>A majestic tale of colonialism and transformation, <i>Mount Pleasant</i> tells the astonishing story of the birth of modern Cameroon, a place subject to the whims of the French and the Germans, yet engaged in a cultural revolution.</p><p>In 1931, Sara is taken from her family and brought to Mount Pleasant as a gift for Sultan Njoya, a ruler cast into exile by French colonialists. Merely nine years old, she is on the verge of becoming the sultan&#x2019;s 681st wife. But when she is dragged to Bertha, the long-suffering slave charged with training Njoya&#x2019;s brides, Sara&#x2019;s life takes a curious turn. Bertha sees within this little girl her son Nebu, who died tragically years before, and she saves Sara from her fate by disguising her as her son. In Sara&#x2019;s new life as a boy she bears witness to the world of Sultan Njoya---a magical yet vulnerable community of artists and intellectuals---and learns of the sultan&#x2019;s final days in the Palace of All Dreams and the sad fate of Nebu, the greatest artist their culture had ever seen.</p><p>Seven decades later, a student returns home to Cameroon to learn about the place it once was, and she finds Sara, silent for years, ready to tell her story. But her serpentine tale, entangled by flawed memory and bursts of the imagination, reinvents history anew. The award-winning novelist Patrice Nganang&#x2019;s<i> Mount Pleasant</i> is a lyrical resurrection of early-twentieth-century Cameroon and an elegy to the people swept up in the forces of colonization.</p></p><p><b>Patrice Nganang</b> was born in Cameroon and is a novelist, a poet, and an essayist. His novel <i>Temps de chien</i> received the Prix Litt�raire Marguerite Yourcenar and the Grand prix litt�raire d'Afrique noire. He is also the author of <i>La Joie de vivre</i> and <i>L'Invention d'un beau regard</i>. He teaches comparative literature at Stony Brook University.<p>"Patrice Nganang&#x2019;s dazzling novel [stands] in a league of its own, so different from the great majority of novels by African writers in the past fifty or sixty years." &#x2015;Charles R. Larson, <i>Counterpunch</i></p><p>"Cameroonian writer Nganang delivers a modern epic, tinged with liberal doses of magical realism, of life in his country's colonial era . . . An elegantly drawn and engaging world of a sort unknown to most readers&#x2015;but one they'll be glad to have visited." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews </i>(starred review)</p></p><h2>The Essential Cocktail: The Art of Mixing Perfect Drinks</h2><p>Dale DeGroff is widely regarded as the world&#x2019;s foremost mixologist. Hailed by the <i>New York Times</i> as &#x201c;single-handedly responsible for what&#x2019;s been called the cocktail renaissance,&#x201d; he earned this reputation during his twelve years at the fashionable Promenade Bar in New York City&#x2019;s Rainbow Room. It was there in 1987 that he not only reintroduced the cocktail menu to the country but also began mixing drinks from scratch, using impeccably fresh ingredients instead of the widespread mixes used at the time. Known especially for crafting unique cocktails, reviving classics, and coaxing superior flavor from his ingredients, DeGroff has selected his 100 essential drinks and 100 of their best variations&#x2014;including many of his signature cocktails&#x2014;for this premier mixology guide.<br><br><i>The Essential Cocktail </i>features only those drinks that stand out for their flavor, interesting formula, or distinctive technique. These are the very ones every amateur and professional bartender must know, the martinis, sours, highballs, tropicals, punches, sweets, and classics, both old and new, that form the core of a connoisseur&#x2019;s repertoire. Throughout the book are DeGroff&#x2019;s personal twists, such as a tangy Grapefruit Julep or a refreshing Yuzu Gimlet.<br><br>To complement the tantalizing photographs of each essential cocktail, DeGroff also regales readers with the fascinating lore behind a drink&#x2019;s genesis and instructs us on using the right ingredients, techniques, glasses, and garnishes. As Julia Child&#x2019;s <i>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</i> was the classic compendium for home chefs and gourmands, so <i>The Essential Cocktail</i> will be the go-to book for serious mixologists and cocktail enthusiasts.</p><p>DALE DEGROFF (a.k.a. the King of Cocktails) is universally acknowledged as the world&#x2019;s premier mixologist whose innovations have impacted globally the restaurant and beverage industry. DeGroff provides consulting and bar training to beverage companies, hotels, and leading restaurants throughout the world and has won numerous industry awards. The founder and president of the Museum of the American Cocktail, the first museum in the world dedicated to education in mixology and preserving the rich history of the American cocktail, DeGroff is also the author of <i>The Craft of the Cocktail</i>, winner of the IACP Julia Child Award.Degroff (<i>The Craft of the Cocktail</i>) likes to be referred to as the King of Cocktails, and it is hard to argue the point. During his stint as bartender at Manhattan's Rainbow Room, he shunned packaged mixes and ushered in the use of fresh ingredients for classic drinks as well as potables of his own device. In this book, he offers 100 popular whistle-wetters and 100 variations thereof&#x2014;martinis, sours, highballs and punches are all well represented. A Bloody Mary is never shaken, but rather rolled back and forth, while a Bloody Bull adds beef broth to the recipe and can stand up to a vigorous shake. There's the lowly Long Island Iced Tea, mated with a variation called a Full Monte, which calls for Champagne instead of cola. And a basic Daiquiri (rum, simple syrup, lime juice) is out-boxed by Dale's Hemingway Daiquiri, which adds Maraschino liqueur and grapefruit juice to the mix. 150 full-color photos help sweeten the deal, and historical asides provide fine fodder for party chit-chat. The Tequila Sunrise, it turns out, was created south of the border during Prohibition and included fresh lemonade and French cassis. But when the drink traveled north, inexperienced bartenders dumbed it down to today's mix of OJ and grenadine.

Three years later, one ship returned to port with just 18 men. Magellan was not among the survivors, having been killed in the Philippines. But the remainder of his party, quite inadvertently, had been first to circumnavigate the world.<br>One of the survivors of the voyage was Antonio Pigafetta, a young Italian nobleman and volunteer member of the crew. His diligent and detailed accounting of the expedition is the fullest, most valuable narrative of the voyage and one of the most important geographical documents known. As R. A. Skelton observes in the Introduction, Pigafetta &#x201c;brought to his task of recording a capacity for keen observation, sympathetic interpretation, and expressive communication of experience, which enabled him to produce one of the most remarkable documents in the history of geographical and ethnological discovery.&#x201d; Fortunately for us, Pigafetta recorded &#x201c;all the things that had occurred day by day during our voyage.&#x201d;<br>In addition to naval and military battles and maneuvers, Pigafetta faithfully documented plants and animals, manners and customs, languages and geography of lands and seas never before seen by Europeans. What Magellan and his party did, and what Pigafetta saw and recorded so well, forever changed our concept of the world and vastly enlarged our knowledge of it. This remarkable narrative brings that epochal event vividly to life. R. A. Skelton, who prepared the excellent translation and commentary, was formerly on the staff of the British Museum.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French, Italian</p><h2>Euthyphro. Apology. Crito. Phaedo (Loeb Classical Library)</h2><p><p>Plato of Athens, who laid the foundations of the Western philosophical tradition and in range and depth ranks among its greatest practitioners, was born to a prosperous and politically active family circa 427 BC. In early life an admirer of Socrates, Plato later founded the first institution of higher learning in the West, the Academy, among whose many notable alumni was Aristotle. Traditionally ascribed to Plato are thirty-five dialogues developing Socrates&#x2019; dialectic method and composed with great stylistic virtuosity, together with the <i>Apology</i> and thirteen letters.</p><p>The four works in this volume recount the circumstances of Socrates&#x2019; trial and execution in 399 BC. In <i>Euthyphro</i>, set in the weeks before the trial, Socrates and Euthyphro attempt to define holiness. In <i>Apology</i>, Socrates answers his accusers at trial and unapologetically defends his philosophical career. In <i>Crito</i>, a discussion of justice and injustice explains Socrates&#x2019; refusal of Crito&#x2019;s offer to finance his escape from prison. And in <i>Phaedo</i>, Socrates discusses the concept of an afterlife and offers arguments for the immortality of the soul. This edition, which replaces the original Loeb edition by Harold North Fowler, offers text, translation, and annotation that are fully current with modern scholarship.</p></p><p><p>Chris Emlyn-Jones is Emeritus Professor of Classical Studies, The Open University (UK).</p><p>William Preddy is Retired Head of Classics, Oakham School, Rutland (UK).</p></p><h2>Recovering Spirituality: Achieving Emotional Sobriety in Your Spiritual Practice</h2><p>Guides those in recovery in developing the awareness and skills to deal with life's issues by practicing authentic spirituality and emotional sobriety.<br><br>Spirituality is a critical aspect of the Twelve Steps and other recovery programs. Yet, for those of us disposed to addiction, it can be easy to get so caught up in the idea of our Higher Power and the abundant joys of a spiritual life that we experience "spiritual bypass"--the use of spirituality to avoid dealing with ourselves, our emotions, and our unfinished business.In Recovering Spirituality, researcher and clinical psychologist Ingrid Mathieu uses personal stories and practical advice to teach us how to grow up emotionally and take responsibility for ourselves. Without turning away from the true benefits of an active spiritual program, she shows us how to work through life's challenges and periods of pain while evolving and maintaining an authentic relationship with our Higher Power.</p><p>"This much-needed and deeply important book offers profound insight into the human mind and heart. It looks deeply into the practice of spiritual bypassing--the use of spiritual ideas and practices to attempt to sidestep one's own unfinished emotional business. In unraveling some of the mysteries of relapse and stalled recovery, it also offers an entirely unexpected twist on spiritual bypassing itself.

Mamaw tightened the soft cashmere throw around her thin shoulders. Slivers of light pierced the velvety blackness over the Cove, and pewter-colored shadows danced on the spiky marsh grass like ethereal ghosts.<br> <br>Mamaw sat huddled on an oversize, black wicker chair on her back porch, her legs tucked beneath her. The fog was moist on her face and the predawn chill seemed to penetrate straight to her bones. She couldn&#x2019;t seem to get warm with Lucille gone. Since her dear friend&#x2019;s death, many nights she&#x2019;d awakened from a fitful sleep and come outdoors hoping the fresh air would settle her. She&#x2019;d found scant warmth or peace in the chill of predawn. In the distance, the Atlantic Ocean, her mercurial friend, roared like a hungry beast. The waves were devouring the dunes in a relentless rhythm. Echoes reverberated over Sullivan&#x2019;s Island.<br> <br>Over a week had passed since Lucille&#x2019;s death. Yet she still felt her old friend&#x2019;s presence around her, hovering in death as she had in life. Dear Lucille. Death came to us all. She knew that. Mamaw was no stranger to death. At eighty years of age, she could hardly have been spared the loss of loved ones. She&#x2019;d buried her parents, and, too early, her son and husband. Tonight she felt the past was more alive than the present. Memories of her loved ones played vividly in her mind.<br> <br>Mamaw drew a long, ragged breath. From far away, she heard the mournful bellowing of a ship&#x2019;s foghorn. From a nearby tree, a bird began calling out his strident dawn whistles . . . a cardinal, she thought.<br> <br>She listened, stirred from her lethargy by the dawn song. She watched as the morning light, in degrees, brightened the skyline, revealing the ragged tips of green sea grass, palm trees clustered on a hammock, and the towering Ravenel Bridge, appearing as two great sailing vessels, in the distance. Slowly, the rising sun illuminated the darkness, peeling away the shroud from her heart. She felt her despair dissipate with the mist. Mamaw said a prayer of thanks to the rising sun and took a deep breath of the cool, mud-scented air.<br> <br>Another day was dawning. The worst was over.<br> <br>Foolish old woman, she chided herself as the gray sky shifted to blue. Look at yourself, sitting in the dark, mourning your friend. Wouldn&#x2019;t Lucille give you what for if she spied you moping like this outdoors in the damp chill, still in your nightclothes? Who had time to lollygag? Their plan for the summer was not finished! She&#x2019;d invited her three nearly estranged granddaughters to Sea Breeze in May&#x2014;and they&#x2019;d come. The first time they&#x2019;d been together in over a decade. True, it had so far been a tumultuous summer of change and growth, ups and downs, joys and heartaches. But it was her triumph that they&#x2019;d weathered the vicissitudes together. Eudora, Carson, and Harper had rediscovered the sisterly love they&#x2019;d shared as children when they played together during the summers here on Sullivan&#x2019;s Island. Howling at the moon? She should be crowing like a rooster!<br> <br>Yet, much was still to be done and she was running out of time. It was already August. The sea turtles were finishing another season, the children would be heading back to school, the ospreys would soon head south with the other migrating birds and butterflies. Summer&#x2019;s end was fast approaching. Soon, too, her Summer Girls would be leaving.<br> <br>Mamaw felt a twinge of loss at just the thought. She would miss them&#x2014;their sweet faces, their chatter, tears, laughter. The footfalls in the house, the drama, the hugs and kisses liberally offered. What a summer it had been!<br> <br>Her smile slipped. Not only would her granddaughters leave in the fall. She, too, would be leaving Sea Breeze. Moving to a retirement home when Sea Breeze was sold. With her granddaughters and Lucille gone, she would, she thought with a shudder, be utterly alone.<br> <br>Mamaw lowered her cheek to her palm. She at least knew where she would go at summer&#x2019;s end, but where would her girls go? Each of the women was unsure of what her next step would be when she left the safe embrace of Sea Breeze. Dora&#x2019;s divorce was pending, Carson was pregnant, and Harper was, for lack of a better term, completely adrift.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, Lucille,&#x201d; she said aloud to the presence she felt hovering in the pearly light. &#x201c;You were the one who always rallied me in my dark moments. We lured them here. And there is still much yet to do to finish our plan.&#x201d; She sighed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if I can do it alone. But I must try.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mamaw&#x2019;s eyes rose to the sky, where great shafts of pink and blue continued to break through the horizon. A smile eased across her face. The moon might be gone, she thought. But the sun was rising on another day.<br> <br><br> <br>In another room of Sea Breeze, Harper lay on her bed in the steely light, her hands tucked beneath her head, listening to the mighty roar of the ocean. How loud the sound of the waves was this morning, she thought. The echoes reverberated in the still night. She thrilled to the sound, so different from what she was accustomed to in the city.<br> <br>In New York, Harper awoke to the blare of police sirens, honking horns, and banging garbage trucks. So much was different here. She was different here. Over the past few months since she&#x2019;d arrived on Sullivan&#x2019;s Island, her body had slowly acclimated from the fast pace and sense of urgency she experienced in the city to the slower, quieter rhythm of the lowcountry. She no longer went out to parties or bars until late at night, nor did she charge out of bed in the morning at the sound of an alarm. At Sea Breeze her days were ruled by the sun. Early to bed, early to rise.<br> <br>Harper smiled, wondering if she&#x2019;d ever foreseen how much she&#x2019;d enjoy this lifestyle. No, she didn&#x2019;t think she had. In fact, initially she had quite dreaded the prospect of spending time at Sea Breeze this summer. She recalled her outrage when, only a few days after her and her sisters&#x2019; arrival, Mamaw had announced her true intentions: that the women stay the entire summer. Harper stretched languidly while the light brightened to give the room a pearly glow. As she turned to her side to look out the window, her hand brushed against something. Surprised, she sat up to investigate. Sheets of paper lay strewn across her bed and scattered on the floor.<br> <br>She rubbed her eyes as understanding took hold. Her book . . .<br> <br>She must&#x2019;ve fallen asleep while reading her manuscript, she realized, yawning. She rose from her bed and gathered the two-hundred-some sheets into a pile, taking her time to put the pages in order. As she did, her eyes reread a sentence here and there. Not bad, she thought to herself. The emotions in the words felt true. Then again, she was a biased judge. Her mother had made it brutally clear when she was just a girl that she didn&#x2019;t have talent. Just like her father, her mother had said dismissively, waving away Harper&#x2019;s fledgling attempts at short stories and poems. Her mother was a renowned editor, so Harper had taken her words as fact. Those fateful words still stung, even after decades.<br> <br>Since then, Harper hadn&#x2019;t shown her writing to anyone. She&#x2019;d pursued a career as an editor, discovering she had a talent in assisting others with their stories, with taking their innermost thoughts and putting them onto the page.<br> <br>Yet she&#x2019;d found editing others&#x2019; words didn&#x2019;t bring her the same satisfaction as writing her own. So she&#x2019;d continued writing&#x2014;in her room, in coffee shops, on trains&#x2014;in secret. Like a sinful pleasure she could indulge in when she wanted to dish out her anger or amusement. Not until this summer, this block of time she&#x2019;d given herself without interruption&#x2014;or rather, the time that Mamaw had thrust upon her, not taking no for an answer&#x2014;had Harper decided to write a book. A whole body of work with a beginning, a middle, and an end. She would never know whether she could actually write a book until she&#x2019;d finished one. And, she thought, picking up the papers in her hands, she was nearly done.<br> <br>Harper rose and placed the manuscript on her desk, resting her hands on the pile of papers, overcome with a sense of ownership and pride.<br> <br>Her book.<br> <br>Her sisters thought she&#x2019;d been taking the summer off, shamelessly idle while they scrambled to find jobs and apartments. True, she&#x2019;d been enjoying her break at Sea Breeze, gardening, swimming, talking with her sisters, and roaming the far ends of the island. But she&#x2019;d been privately working, too. She didn&#x2019;t dare tell anyone about it, because if she did, she knew they&#x2019;d want to read it.<br> <br>No, she thought, slipping the manuscript into the desk drawer. She would keep her manuscript all to herself. She wasn&#x2019;t as outgoing as her sister Carson, who was quick-witted and clever. Nor was she as bold as her eldest sister, Dora, who had strong opinions on every subject, even when unasked. Harper expressed herself best on paper.<br> <br>And, she thought with a rueful smile, her sisters wouldn&#x2019;t be pleased to learn that she was writing about them.<br> <br>Outside her window she heard the strident dawn whistles of a bird singing in a nearby tree. She paused to listen, wondering what kind of bird it was that awakened her most mornings. She vowed to find out. She wanted to learn the names of the birds and the trees and the plants of this island that she&#x2019;d come to love. She&#x2019;d spent all of her twenty-eight years in beautiful places&#x2014;her mother&#x2019;s fashionable apartment overlooking Central Park in New York City, the house in the Hamptons, and her grandparents&#x2019; manor house in England. Not to mention the exclusive boarding schools and Ivy League college she&#x2019;d attended. But nowhere did she feel so at home or content, or as much herself, as she did here in the lowcountry, by the ocean, at Sea Breeze.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d be leaving soon.<br> <br>The thought came unbidden and struck a chord of sadness in the morning&#x2019;s sweet music. Harper went to the window and opened the wooden slats of the plantation shutter to peer out. Pale gray light illuminated the shadows. Carson was always nattering on about how glorious it was to be out on the water when the dawn exploded over the ocean. How it was her favorite time of the day. Carson could be so passionate about anything connected to water.<br> <br>Harper suddenly felt a stirring to witness that sight for herself. Why not now? she asked herself. Before it was too late. What was she waiting for?<br> <br>She quickly slipped into a swimsuit and denim shorts. Laced up her running shoes. As quietly as the mouse she was nicknamed after, she slipped open the sliding door that separated her bedroom from her grandmother&#x2019;s. It rattled on the track, and grimacing, she paused. She didn&#x2019;t hear Mamaw stir in her dark bedroom. Harper tiptoed quickly across the carpet, closing the door behind her.<br> <br>The house was quiet, everyone still asleep in the wee morning hour. Even Carson, who, for all her talk, had begun sleeping in after announcing her pregnancy. Making good her escape, Harper flew out the front door, aware that the sun waited for no man or woman. She was met with cool and sweet-tasting morning air. The wind that had roiled the ocean all night had chased away the humidity and heat, leaving the morning air unusually refreshing for August. In the quiet, all sounds were amplified. Above her, the leaves of the great oak tree rustled in the breeze and the palm fronds rattled. Beneath her feet the gravel crunched loudly as she hurried across the driveway to the garage. The rusty, trusty old bicycle leaned against the wall. She pulled it out from the garage, swung her leg over the seat, and took off.<br> <br>Despite her twenty-eight years, Harper felt no older than thirteen as she pedaled furiously along the streets. The neighboring houses appeared blanketed in the shadows, their occupants still asleep in the hush over the island. Only a few feral cats darted soundlessly across the roads. She hadn&#x2019;t seen as many of them clustering on the island this summer as she remembered from her girlhood summers spent at Sea Breeze. People said it was the coyotes. She kept her eyes peeled as she pushed on along the muted street. Past Stella Maris Catholic Church, with its hallowed steeple. Past the ominous, giant molelike burrows of Fort Moultrie. Past the tight cluster of restaurants, shuttered now and deserted. Only a few joggers and an occasional automobile shared the road with her.<br> <br>At last she reached the northern tip of the island, where Carson had told her the surfers gathered. She turned off Middle Street toward the sea. Several cars, all with roof racks for surfboards, crowded the narrow side streets. Harper pushed the wheels of her bike through the soft sand of the path past the tall barrier of shrubs. The surf was unusually loud this morning. When at last the path opened up to the beach, she stopped to catch her breath.<br> <br>The dusky blue sky and gray sea came together to form one infinite horizon line. The sun did not rush to her glory. She rose at her own pace, imperious, radiant, bursting in her display of achingly beautiful pastels that were reflected on the water. Harper felt small in the presence of a view so profound. Yet at the same time, she felt connected to it. Empowered to be part of this godlike perpetuity. In that dazzling moment she felt the glistening light enter her soul to fill her with hope. Harper understood at last why Carson so loved this moment, had risen early to catch it day after day. It truly was spiritual.<br> <br>Harper clutched the handlebars of her beach cruiser tight. The new day was spread out before her like a blank page, ready for her to fill with her words, thoughts, feelings. She&#x2019;d given herself this one summer to discover&#x2014;at long last&#x2014;what she wanted to do with her life. No longer would she continue meekly following what her mother had planned.<br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t know what her future would bring. Standing in the glow of the rising sun, Harper was filled with a tingling sensation that her future was only just beginning.<br> <br><br> <br>The sea was calling her. Carson lay in the dim light of her bedroom listening to the incessant roar of her old friend the ocean. It was rare for the waves to come in hard, as they were now. When they did, Carson had always grabbed her board and gone to the water. It was in her nature to do so. Salt water ran in her veins.<br> <br>Carson didn&#x2019;t jump from her bed this morning, however. She continued to lie still, her palms resting on her abdomen. She no longer was free to follow her whims. No longer the fearless surfer or world traveler, able to pick up and leave when she wished.<br> <br>She let her fingers gently stroke her belly, still flat despite the life growing beneath the taut skin. So much for her womanly intuition. It had taken the echolocation of one very intuitive dolphin to tell her she was pregnant.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, baby,&#x201d; she crooned. &#x201c;What am I going to do with you? I&#x2019;m not married, I don&#x2019;t have a job, I don&#x2019;t even have my own place to live. How am I going to take care of you?&#x201d;<br> <br>She brought to mind her last conversation with Lucille, the night she&#x2019;d died. Carson had been struggling with what to do about the pregnancy and went to Lucille to sit at her knee, as she had so many times growing up, and once more ask for advice. Lucille hadn&#x2019;t told her what to do. That wasn&#x2019;t her style. Instead, the old woman guided Carson&#x2019;s thoughts to find her own answer. Carson would never forget ...</p><h2>How to Think About Analysis</h2><p>Analysis (sometimes called Real Analysis or Advanced Calculus) is a core subject in most undergraduate mathematics degrees. It is elegant, clever and rewarding to learn, but it is hard. Even the best students find it challenging, and those who are unprepared often find it incomprehensible at first. This book aims to ensure that no student need be unprepared. It is not like other Analysis books. It is not a textbook containing standard content. Rather, it is designed to be read before arriving at university and/or before starting an Analysis course, or as a companion text once a course is begun. It provides a friendly and readable introduction to the subject by building on the student's existing understanding of six key topics: sequences, series, continuity, differentiability, integrability and the real numbers. It explains how mathematicians develop and use sophisticated formal versions of these ideas, and provides a detailed introduction to the central definitions, theorems and proofs, pointing out typical areas of difficulty and confusion and explaining how to overcome these. <br><br>The book also provides study advice focused on the skills that students need if they are to build on this introduction and learn successfully in their own Analysis courses: it explains how to understand definitions, theorems and proofs by relating them to examples and diagrams, how to think productively about proofs, and how theories are taught in lectures and books on advanced mathematics. It also offers practical guidance on strategies for effective study planning. The advice throughout is research based and is presented in an engaging style that will be accessible to students who are new to advanced abstract mathematics.<br></p><p><br>Lara Alcock, <em>Senior Lecturer, Mathematics Education Centre, Loughborough University</em><br><br>Lara Alcock is a Senior Lecturer in the Mathematics Education Centre at Loughborough University.

In <i>From the Inside Out</i>, Jill Lindsey Harrison offers an account of the bureaucratic culture that hinders regulatory agencies' attempts to reduce environmental injustices. </p><p>It is now widely accepted that America's poorest communities, communities of color, and Native American communities suffer disproportionate harm from environmental hazards, with higher exposure to pollution and higher incidence of lead poisoning, cancer, asthma, and other diseases linked to environmental ills. And yet, Harrison reports, some regulatory staff view these problems as beyond their agencies' area of concern, requiring too many resources, or see neutrality as demanding &#x201c;color-blind&#x201d; administration. Drawing on more than 160 interviews (with interviewees including 89 current or former agency staff members and more than 50 environmental justice activists and others who interact with regulatory agencies) and more than 50 hours of participant observation of agency meetings (both open- and closed-door), Harrison offers a unique account of how bureaucrats resist, undermine, and disparage environmental justice reform&#x2015;and how environmental justice reformers within the agencies fight back by trying to change regulatory practice and culture from the inside out.

A timeless baseball classic and a must read for any fan worthy of the name, Nine Innings dissects a single baseball game played in June 1982 -- inning by inning, play by play. Daniel Okrent, a seasoned writer and lifelong fan, chose as his subject a Milwaukee Brewers&lt;endash&gt;Baltimore Orioles matchup, though it could have been any game, because, as Okrent reveals, the essence of baseball, no matter where or when it's played, has been and will always be the same. In this particular moment of baseball history you will discover myriad aspects of the sport that are crucial to its nature but so often invisible to the fans -- the hidden language of catchers' signals, the physiology of pitching, the balance sheet of a club owner, the gait of a player stepping up to the plate. With the purity of heart and unwavering attention to detail that characterize our national pastime, Okrent goes straight to the core of the world's greatest game. You'll never watch baseball the same way again.</p><p>Daniel Okrent, the author of <i>The Ultimate Baseball Book</i>, has written not just another windy paean to the national pastime, full of labored metaphors and recollections of demolished stadiums, but a detailed, digressive breakdown of a single early-season game between the Milwaukee Brewers and the Baltimore Orioles on June 10, 1982. Along the way the reader learns about the history of the slider, the building of the Orioles by their famed manager, Earl Weaver, how batters' swings reveal their personality, and even which brand of vitamin C can be found in a certain player's locker. It's a labor of love, but an enthralling one that reveals the complexities at the heart of this most complex and maddening game.Daniel Okrent is an editor-at-large at TIME, INC., and has published four books, including the best-selling BASEBALL ANECDOTES and NINE INNINGS: THE ANATOMY OF A BASEBALL GAME. The author resides in New York City.</p><h2>The Elder and His Work</h2><p><i>The Elder and His Work</i> is a classic that conveys the gravity and importance of the elder's calling. Nineteenth-century author David Dickson provided this brief, complete manual describing the qualifications and duties of elders.<br><br>According to Dickson, an elder is a shepherd of Christ's flock and a student of God's Word-a man growing in the gracious disciplines of the Christian life.<br><br>This edition has Scripture references, updated spelling and usage, explanatory notes, and study questions for personal reflection and group discussion.</p><p><b>David Dickson</b> was an elder in nineteenth-century Scotland. At the age of thirty, he was ordained as an elder in the Free New North Church, and he served as clerk of session for thirty-three years. His practical experiences as an elder led him to publish <i>The Elder and His Work</i>."Dickson's work has a continuing relevance for today's church and its leaders. Both teaching and ruling elders will benefit from this excellent work, and the whole church will be nurtured and strengthened." --<b>J. Stafford Carson</b><br><br>"Though this book was written by a Scottish ruling elder over 150 years ago, Dickson sets forth the framework for the ruling elder in shepherding God's flock. Rediscovering these biblical principles and practicing them would impact today's church." --<b>Charles Dunahoo</b><br><br>"Phil Ryken and George McFarland have served us well by bringing this classic on the shepherding ministry of elders up-to-date and back into print. The thoughtful tone of this work is convicting, encouraging us to be the shepherds God has raised up for the good of His flock and the glory of His name. I can't wait to use this with our own elders!" --<b>Mark Dever</b></p><h2>Man Alive: A True Story of Violence, Forgiveness and Becoming a Man (City Lights/Sister Spit)</h2><p><p><strong>Winner - Best Transgender Nonfiction - 2015 Lambda Literary Awards</strong></p><p><strong>Best Books of 2014 - <em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong></p><p><strong>Best Books of 2014 - NPR Books</strong></p><p><strong>Best Nonficton Books of 2014 - <em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong></p><p><strong>10 Best Transgender Non-Fiction Books - <em>Advocate</em></strong></p><p>"Thomas Page McBee&#x2019;s <em>Man Alive</em> hurtled through my life.

There had been whispers and murmurs of discontent from certain quarters and the British government began to prepare for the inevitable war. After seven weeks training with the 2nd/5th Battalion Leicester, he found himself facing the might of the German army in a muddy field south of Cherbourg, in Northern France, with just thirty rounds of ammunition in his weapon pouch. Horace's war didn't last long. He was taken prisoner on 25th May 1940 and forced to endure a ten week march across France and Belgium en-route to Holland. <br><br>Horace survived...barely...food was scarce; he took nourishment from dandelion leaves, small insects and occasionally a secret food package from a sympathetic villager, and drank rain water from ditches. Many of his fellow comrades were not so fortunate. Falling by the side of the road through sheer exhaustion and malnourishment meant a bullet through the back of the head and the corpse left to rot. After a three day train journey without food and water, Horace found himself incarcerated in a prison camp in Poland. It was there he embarked on an incredible love affair with a German girl interpreting for his captors.<br><br>He experienced the sweet taste of freedom each time he escaped to see her, yet incredibly he made his way back into the camp each time, sometimes two, three times every week. Horace broke out of the camp then crept back in again under the cover of darkness after his natural urges were fulfilled. He brought food back to his fellow prisoners to supplement their meagre rations. He broke out of the camp over two hundred times and towards the end of the war even managed to bring radio parts back in. The BBC news would be delivered daily to over 3,000 prisoners. This is an incredible tale of one man's adversity and defiance of the German nation.</p><p></p><h2>Can I Get A Witness?: Reading Revelation Through African American Culture</h2><p><p>In this accessible and provocative study, Brian Blount reads the book of Revelation through the lens of African American culture, drawing correspondences between Revelation's context and the long-standing suffering of African Americans. Applying the African American social, political, and religious experience as an interpretive cipher for the book's complicated imagery, he contends that Revelation is essentially a story of suffering and struggle amid oppressive assimilation. He examines the language of "martyr" and the image of the lamb, and shows that the thread of resistance to oppressive power that runs through John's hymns resonates with a parallel theme in the music of African America.</p></p><p><b>Brian K.

And the business press is abuzz with the wonders of analytics. Increasingly, marketing decision making is becoming like design engineering&#x2014; putting together concepts, data, analyses, and simulations to learn about the marketplace (analytics) and to design effective marketing plans (engineering). While many view traditional marketing as art and some view it as science, the new marketing increasingly looks like engineering (that is, combining art and science to solve specific problems). We offer an accessible overview of the most widely used marketing engineering and analytics concepts and tools and show how they drive the collection of the right data and information to perform the right analyses to make better marketing plans, better product designs, and better marketing decisions. We have designed this book primarily for the business school student or marketing manager, who, with minimal background and technical training, must understand and employ the basic tools and models associated with marketing engineering and analytics. The interested reader can go beyond the conceptual material in this book and learn how to apply these concepts using the software tools, cases and exercises available at www.DecisionPro.biz. That material, in concert with the descriptions here will both inform the reader and translate the concepts here into context-specific decisions and actions.</p><p></p><h2>Maud&#39;s Line</h2><p><b>FINALIST FOR THE PULITZER PRIZE</b><br><br><i>A debut novel chronicling the life and loves of a headstrong, earthy, and magnetic heroine</i><br><br> Eastern Oklahoma, 1928.

Max Brod, Kafka&#x2019;s literary executor, relates that Kafka actually gave the letter to his mother to hand to his father, hoping it might renew a relationship that had lost itself in tension and frustration on both sides. But Kafka&#x2019;s probing of the deep flaw in their relationship spared neither his father nor himself. He could not help seeing the failure of communication between father and son as another moment in the larger existential predicament depicted in so much of his work. Probably realizing the futility of her son&#x2019;s gesture, Julie Kafka did not deliver the letter but instead returned it to its author.</p><p><b>FRANZ KAFKA&nbsp;</b>was born in Prague in 1883 and died of tuberculosis in a sanatorium near Vienna in 1924. After earning a law degree in 1906, he worked for most of his adult life at the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute in Prague. Only a small portion of Kafka's writings were published during his lifetime. He left instructions for his friend and literary executor Max Brod to destroy all of his unpublished work after his death, instructions Brod famously ignored.Dearest Father,<br><br>You asked me recently why I maintain that I am afraid of you. As usual, I was unable to think of any answer to your question, partly for the very reason that I am afraid of you, and partly because an explanation of the grounds for this fear would mean going into far more details than I could even approximately keep in mind while talking. And if I now try to give you an answer in writing, it will still be very incomplete, because, &nbsp;even in writing, this fear and its consequences hamper me in relation to you and because the magnitude of the subject goes far beyond the scope of my memory and power of reasoning.<br><br>To you the matter always seemed very simple, at least in to far as you talked about it in front of me, and indiscriminately in front of many other people. It looked to you more of less as follows: you have worked hard all you life, have sacrificed everything for your children, above all for me, consequently I have lived high and handsome, have been completely at liberty to learn whatever I wanted, and have had no cause for material worries, which means worries of any kind at all. You have not expected any gratitude for this, knowing what "children's gratitude" is like, but have expected at least some sort of obligingness, some sign of sympathy. Instead I have always hidden from you, in my room, among my books, with crazy friends, or with extravagant ideas. I have never talked to you frankly; I have never come to you when you were in the synagogue, never visited you at Franzensbad, not indeed ever shown any familiy feeling. I have never taken any interest in the business or your other concerns; I left the factory on your hands and walked off; I encouraged Ottla in her obstinacy, and never lifted a finger for you (never even got you a theater ticket), while I do everything for my friends. If you sum up your judgment of me, the result you get it that, although you don't charge me with anything downright improper or wicked (with the exception perhaps of my latest marriage plan), you do charge me with coldness, estrangement, and ingratitude. And, what is more, you charge me with it in such a way as to make it seem my fault, as though I might have been able, with something like a touch on the steering wheel, to make everything quite different, while you aren't in the slightest to blame, unless it be for having been too good to me.<br><br>This, your usual way of representing it, I regard as accurate only in so far as I too believe you are entirely blameless in the matter of our estrangement. But I am equally entirely blameless. If I could get you to acknowledge this, then what would be possible is&#x2014;not, I think, a new life, we are both much too old for that&#x2014;but still, a kind of peace; no cessation, but still, a diminution of your unceasing reproaches.<br><br>Oddly enough you have some sort of notion of what I mean. For instance, a short time ago you said to me: "I have always been fond of you, even though outwardly I didn't act toward you as other fathers generally do, and this precisely because I can't pretend as other people can." Now, Father, on the whole I have never doubted your goodness toward me, but this remark I consider wrong. You can't pretend, that is true, but merely for that reason to maintain that other fathers pretend is either more opinionatedness, and as such beyond discussion, or on the other hand&#x2014;and this in my view is what it really is&#x2014;a veiled expression of the fact that something is wrong in our relationship and that you have played your part in causing it to be so, but without it's being your fault. If you really mean that, then we are in agreement...</p><h2>Finance for Real Estate Development</h2><p>Explaining how finances drive each decision in the real estate development process, this helpful industry guide recognizes the complexities and significant risks of each project and illustrates how to reconcile conflicting elements to ultimately achieve success.

Cereal. Crackers. Spaghetti. Beer. I lived alone, worked a lot, and rarely cooked. I was checking a price when I almost ran into the girl. I stopped immediately and studied her in profile, her hand raised to her mouth while she examined products through the glass door of the dairy cooler.</p><p>I felt like I was seeing a ghost.</p><p>She looked exactly like my college girlfriend, Marissa Minor, the only woman I had ever really loved. Probably the only woman who had ever really loved me.</p><p>The girl didn&#x2019;t see me right away. She continued to examine the items in front of her, slowly walking away from me, her hand still raised to her mouth as though that helped her think.</p><p>The gesture really got me. It made my insides go cold. Not with fear, but with shock. With feelings I hadn&#x2019;t felt in years.</p><p>Marissa used to do the very same thing. When she was thinking, she&#x2019;d place her right hand on her lips, sometimes pinching them between her index finger and thumb. Marissa&#x2019;s lips were always bright red&#x2014;without lipstick&#x2014;and full, and that gesture, that lip-twisting, thoughtful gesture, drove me wild with love and, yes, desire.</p><p>I was eighteen when I met her. Desire was always close at hand.</p><p>But it wasn&#x2019;t just the gesture that this girl shared with Marissa. Her hair, thick and deep red, matched Marissa&#x2019;s exactly, even the length of it, just below her shoulders. From the side, the girl&#x2019;s nose came to a slightly rounded point, one that Marissa always said looked like a lightbulb. Both the girl and Marissa had brown eyes, and long, slender bodies. This girl, the one in the store, looked shorter than Marissa by a few inches, and she wore tight jeans and knee-high boots, clothes that weren&#x2019;t in style when I attended college.</p><p>But other than that, they could have been twins. They really could have been.</p><p>And as the girl walked away, making a left at the end of the aisle and leaving my sight, I remained rooted to my spot, my silly little grocery basket dangling from my right hand. The lights above were bright, painfully so, and other shoppers came past with their carts and their kids and their lives. It was close to dinnertime, and people had places to go. Families to feed.</p><p>But I stood there.</p><p>I felt tears rising in my eyes, my vision starting to blur.</p><p>She looked so much like Marissa. So much.</p><p>But Marissa had been dead for just over twenty years.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Finally, I snapped out of it.</p><p>I reached up with my free hand and wiped my eyes.</p><p>No one seemed to notice that I was having an emotional moment in the middle of the grocery store, in the milk aisle. I probably looked like a normal guy. Forty years old. Clean-cut. Professional. I had my problems. I was divorced. My ex-wife didn&#x2019;t let me see her son as much as I wanted. He wasn&#x2019;t my kid, but we&#x2019;d grown close. My job as a caseworker for the housing authority in Eastland, Ohio, didn&#x2019;t pay enough, but who ever felt like they were paid enough? I enjoyed the work. I enjoyed helping people. I tended to pour myself into it.</p><p>Outside of work, I spent my life like a lot of single people do. I socialized with friends, even though most of them were married and had kids. I played in a recreational basketball league. When I had the time and motivation, I volunteered at our local animal shelter, walking dogs or making fund-raising calls.</p><p>Like I said, I probably looked like a regular guy.</p><p>I decided I needed to talk to that girl. I started down the aisle, my basket swinging at my side. I figured she had to be a relative of Marissa&#x2019;s, right? A cousin or something. I turned the corner in the direction she had gone, deftly dodging between my fellow shoppers.</p><p>I looked up the next aisle and didn&#x2019;t see her. Then I went to another one, the last aisle in the store. At first, I didn&#x2019;t see the girl there either. It was crowded, and a family of four&#x2014;two parents, two kids&#x2014;blocked my view. One of the kids was screaming because her mom wouldn&#x2019;t buy her the ice cream she wanted.</p><p>But then they moved, and I saw the girl. She was halfway down the aisle, opening the door of another cooler, but not removing anything. She lifted her hand to her mouth. That gesture. She looked just like Marissa.</p><p>I felt the tears again and fought back against them.</p><p>I walked up to her. She looked so small. And young. I guessed she was about twenty, probably a student at my alma mater, Eastland University. I felt ridiculous, but I had to ask who she was. I wiped at my eyes again and cleared my throat.</p><p>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>She whipped her head around in my direction. She seemed startled that anyone had spoken to her.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>But I really wasn&#x2019;t. In that moment, I saw her head-on instead of in profile, and the resemblance to Marissa became more pronounced. Her forehead was a little wider than Marissa&#x2019;s. And her chin came to a sharper point. But the spray of freckles, the shape of her eyes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all of it was Marissa.</p><p>If I believed in ghosts&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Ghosts from a happy time in my past&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; I said again.</p><p>The girl just looked at me. Her eyes moved across my body, sizing me up. Taking me in. She looked guarded.</p><p>&#x201c;I was wondering if you were related to the Minor family,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;They lived in Hanfort, Ohio. It&#x2019;s been about twenty years since I&#x2019;ve seen them. I know it&#x2019;s a long shot&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The girl had been holding a box of Cheerios and a carton of organic milk. When I said the name &#x201c;Minor,&#x201d; she let them both go, and they fell to the floor at my feet. The milk was in a cardboard carton, but the force of it hitting the floor caused it to split open. Milk leaked onto the cruddy linoleum, flowing toward my shoes.</p><p>&#x201c;Careful,&#x201d; I said, reaching out for her.</p><p>But the girl took off. She made an abrupt turn and started walking away briskly, her bootheels clacking against the linoleum. She didn&#x2019;t look back. And when she reached the far end of the aisle, the end closest to the cash registers, she started running.</p><p>I took one step in that direction, lifting my hand. I wanted to say something. Apologize. Call her back. Let her know that I hadn&#x2019;t meant any harm.</p><p>But she was gone.</p><p>Just like Marissa, she was gone.</p><p>Then the family of four, the one I had seen earlier with the child screaming for ice cream, came abreast of me. The child appeared to have calmed down. She clutched a carton of Rocky Road, the tears on her face drying. The father pointed to the mess on the floor, the leaking milk and the cereal.</p><p>&#x201c;Something wrong with her?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>My hands were shaking. I felt off-balance. Above my head, the cloying Muzak played, indifferent to my little drama with the girl who looked so much like Marissa.</p><p>&#x201c;I have no idea,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know who she was.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>I thought of Marissa all evening. It&#x2019;s safe to say I was feeling a little sorry for myself. Indulging in nostalgia, which can be enjoyable up to a point.</p><p>I drank beer on the couch in my apartment while a basketball game I didn&#x2019;t care about played on the TV. A pile of work waited in my briefcase, but I ignored it. I never did that, but after seeing the girl in the store, I did. I ate some cheese and crackers but gave up on my plan to cook the spaghetti I&#x2019;d bought. My only company that night was Riley, the aging mutt I&#x2019;d rescued from the local humane society shortly after my divorce two years earlier. I volunteered there to keep myself busy and to give something back. Eventually, they convinced me to take a dog home. He looked to be a mixture of German shepherd and retriever, and the humane society had estimated his age to be at least eight when I adopted him, maybe older.</p><p>The humane society didn&#x2019;t know much about Riley&#x2019;s life before he was abandoned to their care, but they suspected he&#x2019;d suffered some neglect or abuse, because he was so passive and skittish when I adopted him. He used to jump and cower at every noise, and he rarely if ever barked or growled. He&#x2019;d grown slowly more comfortable and confident over the previous couple of years, and I&#x2019;d grown used to having him around. As I lounged on the couch, brooding, he sat at my feet, hoping for cracker crumbs.</p><p>Marissa and I had met during our freshman year at Eastland University. When I thought of who I was when I arrived at college, I realized I was just an awkward man-boy who only dreamed of meeting his soul mate. Marissa was beautiful, confident, outgoing, determined. Meeting her unlocked things in me that might never have been unlocked otherwise. She got me like no one ever had. And no one has since. We understood each other without words. I felt my connection to her in the deepest core of my being. How many people meet someone like that in their lives? Not many, but I did. And then, two years later, she was taken away from me in a house fire on a warm fall weekend.</p><p>That was why seeing the girl in the grocery store shook me to the core. I had managed to get on with my life. I had managed to tell myself I&#x2019;d gotten over losing Marissa.</p><p>But I hadn&#x2019;t.</p><p>I went into my bedroom and dug around in the bottom of my closet. I kept a shoebox there full of items from my time in college, mostly things from my relationship with Marissa. Letters, notes, ticket stubs. And the multiple-time-zone watch she gave me on my twentieth birthday.</p><p>We were supposed to travel after college, which explained the need for a multiple-time-zone watch. We never got to take those trips, and I never wore the watch again after Marissa died. But I kept it, and from time to time I&#x2019;d take it out of the box. When the battery died every few years, I&#x2019;d take the watch to the jewelry store and have it replaced. I liked to think about that watch being there, close by me, and always running like a beating heart.</p><p>I brought it back to the couch with me and slumped down into the cushions, opening another beer. I was supposed to play in my basketball league, but I just didn&#x2019;t feel like it. I never drank very much, never more than one a day, if that, but when I came home from the grocery store that night, I threw back three and then four and opened a fifth, staring at my watch and wondering who that girl was. And why she&#x2019;d acted so damn spooked when I simply spoke to her.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>I fell asleep on the couch, the TV still playing, the open but unfinished fifth beer on the coffee table before me. My neck felt like hell from sleeping at an odd angle, and a trail of drool ran down my chin.</p><p>I slept until something started beating against my apartment door.</p><p>Someone was there, pounding on the outside. Each heavy knock caused a miniature earthquake in my skull. I winced. A hangover at my age. Pathetic. I vowed never to have more than one beer again. I vowed to stop thinking about Marissa.</p><p>I probably would have agreed to anything to get the pounding on the door to stop. But it didn&#x2019;t.</p><p>I turned my head to the right, looking at the watch Marissa gave me. 6:53 a.m. 12:53 a.m. the next day in New Zealand, as if I needed to know that.</p><p>I normally woke up around eight. Made it to the office by nine. But I felt like shit. I needed a shower. Coffee. Food. I stood up, feeling a little wobbly. I looked down at Riley. He hadn&#x2019;t barked despite the pounding on the door. He never barked.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing?&#x201d; I said to him. &#x201c;Not even a growl?&#x201d;</p><p>His tail thumped against the floor, and he yawned.</p><p>&#x201c;One of these days I&#x2019;m really going to need your help,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I hope you&#x2019;re ready.&#x201d;</p><p>Riley walked off toward the kitchen, which meant he was hungry.</p><p>I was still wearing my work clothes from the day before. My tie and my shoes were off, and I needed to pee. But whoever was outside the door really wanted to talk to me. The person beat on the door again, shaking my brain like dice in a cup.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Jesus.&#x201d;</p><p>I thought about calling the apartment complex security guard and asking him to find out who was making the endless racket. But he was an elderly man, the owner&#x2019;s uncle, and he usually didn&#x2019;t arrive until late morning and was gone by five. The noise wasn&#x2019;t the knock of a friend or someone selling something. It sounded urgent, determined. But my desire to make it stop overwhelmed any fears I had about who was out there. I stumbled to the door and looked through the peephole.</p><p>It took a moment for the scene outside to make sense to me, but when it did, my heart started racing.</p><p>I understood immediately why the knock was so heavy.</p><p>Through the peephole I saw two uniformed police officers and a detective I already knew.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Hansen,&#x201d; the detective said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the Eastland Police. We know you&#x2019;re in there. Open up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Damn,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>An already rough morning became totally shitty.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>The morning sun nearly killed me.</p><p>It poured in when I opened the door, its rays penetrating my eyeballs like knitting needles. I took a step back, feeling as if I were a man under siege.</p><p>&#x201c;Can we come in?&#x201d; the detective said.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t have to answer. He was already stepping across the threshold with the two uniformed officers right behind him.</p><p>&#x201c;You can do anything you want if it means you&#x2019;ll stop knocking,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Detective Reece stood about five-nine, a few inches shorter than me, but he was powerfully and compactly built. I suspected he&#x2019;d wrestled in high school. Or maybe played nose tackle at a small college. He looked like that kind of guy. He didn&#x2019;t offer to shake my hand, but I&#x2019;d shaken it before, the last time he and I had encountered each other. I remembered he possessed a strong grip, and I always pictured him sitting at his desk, endlessly squeezing one of those hand strengtheners.</p><p>Reece saw the beer cans on the coffee table, and he raised his eyebrows. He was probably a few years younger than me, and his hair was thinning. He wore it cropped close to his head, and his suit coat looked too small for him.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s recycling day,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Think green, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>He pointed at Riley. &#x201c;Does the dog bite?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Only his food,&#x201d; I said, trying to keep the mood light.</p><p>But Reece wasn&#x2019;t smiling. He looked around the room, taking it all in. The TV still played with the sound down, showing highlights of a hockey game from the night before. There were dirty dishes in my sink, discarded gym clothes on the floor. I needed to pick up, and I would have if I&#x2019;d only known the police were going to show up.</p><p>&#x201c;Have you seen your ex-wife lately?&#x201d; Reece asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Not in six weeks,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Not since&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that night you and I met.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The night of the late unpleasantness,&#x201d; Reece said.</p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t stalking her.&#x201d;</p><p>Reece turned to one of the uniformed officers. &#x201c;He says he wasn&#x2019;t stalking her. The ex-wife says he was. Who would you believe?&#x201d;</p><p>The young uniformed cop didn&#x2019;t answer....</p></p><h2>Self-Liberation through Seeing with Naked Awareness</h2><p>A text belonging to the same cycle as <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>, this instruction on the method of&nbsp; self-liberation presents the essence of Dzogchen, <i>The Great Perfection</i>, regarded in Tibet as the highest and most esoteric teaching of the Buddha.

Set to the familiar tune of "If You're Happy and You Know It," this rendition has a downloadable CD, performed by Adrian Emberley, on the publisher's website. The exceptionally bright, digitally created monsters are set against a black background, which makes them almost 3-D in appearance. Each verse appears in an easy-to-read font and in a variety of colors that show up clearly on the dark page. The Emberleys have a knack for creating wonderfully creepy creatures. Though wacky, some with four eyes, pointy teeth, and sharp claws, they are not too scary for even the youngest child. Kids will be only too willing to pretend to be monsters and follow along to "snort and growl," "twitch your tail," and "wriggle your warts," as instructed, in order to prove their monsterness. The last page states, "Now, do it again...," and that will be no problem.<i>Maryann H. Owen, Racine Public Library, WI</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

Is lying always wrong? Is beauty a matter of fact, or a matter of taste? What is discrimination?<br><br>The answers to these questions, and more, are examined in <i>Philosophy for Teens: Questioning Life's Big Ideas</i>, an in-depth, teenager-friendly look at the philosophy behind everyday issues. The authors examine some of life's biggest topics, such as:<ul><li>lying,</li><li>cheating,</li><li>love,</li><li>beauty,</li><li>the role of government,</li><li>hate, and</li><li>prejudice.</li></ul>Both sides of the debates are covered on every issue, with information from some of the world's most noted philosophers included in a conversational style that teenagers will love. Each chapter includes discussion questions, thought experiments, exercises and activities, and community action steps to help students make reasoned, informed decisions about some of life's greatest debates.<br><br>Examining life's big ideas and discovering their own opinions has never been easier or more exciting for today's teens.</p><p>For the past several years, Sharon M. Kaye, Ph.D., and Paul Thomson, Ph.D., taught philosophy to high school students through the Carroll-Cleveland Philosopher&#39;s Program, which won the 2006 American Philosophical Association Award for Excellence and Innovation in Philosophy Programs. They continue to promote the teaching of philosophy to secondary students. Philosophy, the authors believe, allows students to formulate intelligent opinions on major life issues; therefore, their book asks students to make reasoned, informed decisions about some of life&#39;s greatest debates. Kaye currently serves as an associate professor of philosophy at John Carroll University in Cleveland, OH. Thomson currently serves as Philosopher-in-Residence at Columbia Secondary School, a magnet school in New York City, where he coordinates the school&#39;s philosophy courses.Challenging teens to think, this 14-lesson guide introduces major philosophers who have shaped modern Western thought. Explaining the ideas of Plato, Socrates, Aquinas, Locke, Mills, Nietzsche, Sartre, and others through contemporary scenarios, the authors make these great thinkers accessible to teens. Given today's emphasis on mastery of standardized tests, it is important to have material that encourages students to use critical-thinking skills and for which there are no absolute right or wrong answers. The chapters cover Beauty (What is the Purpose of Art?); Truth (Is Lying Always Wrong?), Justice (Who Will Take Care of the Environment?); and God (Why Do Bad Things Happen to Good People?). They include dramatic skits, background on multiple philosophical views, and challenges to construct "thought experiments," imagining a world in which a single philosophy dominates. Discussion questions, activities, community projects, and further readings accompany each lesson. Teachers can use this resource to generate lively debate or to enrich courses in art, religion, history, science, or literature, but they're sure to miss an index when they want to review what individual philosophers said or the sections in which they were mentioned.&#x2014;<i>Kathy Lehman, Thomas Dale High School Library, Chester, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is the fascinating portrait of a group of idealistic men and women who were recruited by the citizen spy service, slapped into uniform, and dispatched to wage political warfare in remote outposts in Ceylon, India, and China.<br> <br>The eager, inexperienced 6 foot 2 inch Julia springs to life in these pages, a gangly golf-playing California girl who had never been farther abroad than Tijuana. Single and thirty years old when she joined the staff of Colonel William Donovan, Julia volunteered to be part of the OSS&#x2019;s ambitious mission to develop a secret intelligence network across Southeast Asia. Her first post took her to the mountaintop idyll of Kandy, the headquarters of Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, the supreme commander of combined operations. Julia reveled in the glamour and intrigue of her overseas assignment and lifealtering romance with the much older and more sophisticated Paul Child, who took her on trips into the jungle, introduced her to the joys of curry, and insisted on educating both her mind and palate. A painter drafted to build war rooms, Paul was a colorful, complex personality. Conant uses extracts from his letters in which his sharp eye and droll wit capture the day-to-day confusion, excitement, and improbability of being part of a cloak- and-dagger operation.<br> <br>When Julia and Paul were transferred to Kunming, a rugged outpost at the foot of the Burma Road, they witnessed the chaotic end of the war in China and the beginnings of the Communist revolution that would shake the world. <i>A Covert Affair </i>chronicles their friendship with a brilliant and eccentric array of OSS agents, including Jane Foster, a wealthy, free-spirited artist, and Elizabeth MacDonald, an adventurous young reporter. In Paris after the war, Julia and Paul remained close to their intelligence colleagues as they struggled to start new lives, only to find themselves drawn into a far more terrifying spy drama. Relying on recently unclassified OSS and FBI documents, as well as previously unpublished letters and diaries, Conant vividly depicts a dangerous time in American history, when those who served their country suddenly found themselves called to account for their unpopular opinions and personal relationships.</p><p>Jennet Conant is the author of&nbsp;<i>Man of the Hour: James B.

Ever since the war, the thin slip of a letter had become permanently fixed in people&#x2019;s minds as a harbinger of death and disaster. Why Julia believed for one moment that it would be good news she could not recall&#x2014;just that she had been so sure. The cable, which reached them in Bonn on Thursday, April 7, 1955, was addressed to her husband, Paul Child. The cursory message took the form of an urgent summons to Washington: REPORT SOONEST FOR CONSULTATION.<br> <br>Julia had been over the moon. She knew exactly why Paul was being called stateside. They were going to make him &#x201c;head of the department.&#x201d; She had even told him as much, her voice brimming with confidence and pride. Incapable of containing her excitement, she had been ready to celebrate then and there. It was silly of her, but characteristic, too. She had gone on happily speculating about the telegram the rest of the evening. Paul had eventually gotten caught up in her mood, his reluctant, mock impatience giving way to anticipation. This, at last, was his promotion, long deserved and long overdue. Then again, when had the State Department ever done anything in a timely fashion?<br> <br>She supposed they should be grateful. Paul had never been particularly ambitious and because he had little patience with bureaucracy had remained mired in the middle ranks of the Foreign Service. He had never intended to pursue a diplomatic career and lacked the necessary instincts. He had simply been rolled into the State Department after the war and eventually found himself, along with most of his old department, reorganized into the newly formed United States Information Service (USIS).&#x201c;Woodenhead the First&#x201d; and &#x201c;Wooden-head the Second,&#x201d; or WH1 and WH2 for short) Paul was finally going to get his due. Perhaps he would get to run his own show or, at the very least, be allowed to pick the members of his own team. There were few things more demoralizing, in Julia&#x2019;s opinion, than &#x201c;working for people you don&#x2019;t admire.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was just the morale boost they both needed. Six months earlier, Julia and Paul had been forced to leave their beloved France and, crueler still, an adorable apartment in the old port city of Marseille, because of an inane government decree that a diplomatic post in any given country could not exceed a period of four years. The three years they had spent in Paris directly after the war, followed by a fifteen-month stint on the southern coast, meant they had exceeded the limit. They had no choice but to pack up and go where they were told.<br> <br>The transfer to Bonn could not have come at a worse time. Julia had been in the midst of testing recipes for a French cookbook she was contracted to write for the Boston publisher Houghton Mifflin with two fellow gourmands she had met in Paris. She knew that the new assignment for Paul not only would take her farther from her collaborators, but would remove her from the country in whose cuisine she should be immersing herself. As difficult as it had been for her to box up her kitchen in Marsailles, Julia understood that the move was infinitely harder on Paul. He had spent his formative years in France, and the language had become second nature to him, as had the internecine squabbling of the locals. The country had captured his heart long before it had taken hold of hers.<br> <br>Leaving Paris for Marseilles had been a wrenching experience, but it was nothing compared to the jolt that Julia and Paul experienced upon learning they were being posted to Bonn. Paul was fluent in a number of languages, but German was not one of them. It was a poor use of his skills, and he was beside himself. While he had long since reconciled himself to the fact that few things in their government agency followed the dictates of logic, this yank of the chain was particularly galling. Julia could think of nothing to say to cheer him up. She had never set foot in Germany and was &#x201c;horrified&#x201d; at the thought. Her memories of World War II were too fresh for her not to dread the idea of settling in Bonn, which had temporarily replaced Berlin as the official seat of the government because it reportedly had less historical baggage. She could only hope she would think better of the new West German capital for having escaped the brunt of the Nazi boot. &#x201c;To think of living in Germany,&#x201d; she grimly wrote Paul&#x2019;s family. &#x201c;Will I ever get over the imagined smell of the gas chambers and the rotting bodies of the Concentration camps. Will we ever be able to learn the language in a couple of months?&#x201d;*<br> <br>Their first glimpse of their new home did nothing to lift their spirits. &#x201c;Woe&#x2014;how did we get here!&#x201d; Julia scribbled in her diary on October 24, 1954, the day they arrived in Bad Godesberg, a drab residential district just south of Bonn. Flush with dollars from the Marshall Plan, the entire Rhine Valley had been rapidly rebuilt as part of the country&#x2019;s economic and industrial redevelopment, and it was full of blocky concrete office buildings and bristling with American soldiers. Julia and Paul were dismayed to find themselves back in the familiar embrace of the U.S. military, assigned to live in a segregated (&#x201c;no Germans allowed!&#x201d;) compound called Plittersdorf on the Rhine, which its unfortunate occupants had dubbed &#x201c;the Golden Ghetto on the Rhine.&#x201d; They had never cared for this part of army life&#x2014;the rows of anonymous housing, streets crawling with jeeps and military policemen, and bars crowded with drunken young men in ill-fitting uniforms who wanted to be anywhere but there. Writing to her sister, Julia griped that she had &#x201c;had enough of that meat-ballery during the war to last her a lifetime.&#x201d; Still, there were plenty of opportunities for escape. Paul&#x2019;s Foreign Service salary enabled them to live well, especially as the dollar was strong against the mark. Whenever possible, they fled across the river to Bonn, a picturesque university town that had been occupied by American troops toward the end of the war and had somehow managed to survive relatively unscathed, its medieval battlements and grand boulevards still redolent of Old World charm. There they could sample the solid regional fare, the sauerbratens and sausages, inevitably served with groaning plates of potato pancakes. Afterward, too full to go far, they would stop to recover at one of the pavement caf�s along the banks of the river.<br> <br>Julia and Paul, like most in their seasoned diplomatic circle, had always been guilty of a certain disdain for GI culture, but what had once been mild distaste had over time developed into a visceral aversion. They wanted no part of the martial fervor that arose in the shadow of the Soviet threat in East Germany. Bonn, the makeshift capital, seemed by virtue of its very impermanence to bring out the worst in its American occupiers, who were so conflicted about their objectives in the divided region that they appeared to be almost paralyzed. Caught between the menacing Soviet Union and Western Europe&#x2019;s fears of military vulnerability, Bonn was emblematic of the tenuous peace, and of the uncertain prospects for American forces and American dollars to achieve a united capitalist postwar Europe to deter the spread of Communism. Writing in <i>The New York Times</i>, Julia and Paul&#x2019;s friend Stewart Alsop observed that the U.S. diplomatic mission in Germany was &#x201c;a peculiarly depressing place for a peculiarly American reason&#x201d; and, in its confusion and excess of caution, was substituting &#x201c;dogma for policy and the official line for serious thought.&#x201d;<br> <br>Within weeks of their arrival in Germany, Julia and Paul had picked up on the atmosphere of distrust and unease. The place was rife with closed-door meetings, simmering tensions, and subterranean plots. They were on the front lines of the Cold War in Europe, though Julia could not help feeling that the chill in the air had its origin in the &#x201c;rampant right wingery&#x201d; that had seized their own country in recent years. In Washington, the mood was so changed that on her last visit home she had scarcely recognized the city as the same place she and Paul had lived in those first happy postwar years.<br> <br>When peace was declared, Americans had celebrated their achievement. The GIs had triumphed over Germany, over Japan, and, in the bargain, over the Great Depression, and in the first glow of euphoria that victory had seemed complete. The United States, with its great economic and military strength, seemed invincible. During the late 1940s, while based in Paris, Julia and Paul had watched as their country&#x2019;s ascendance as a global power led to a new confidence in its role in international affairs, as well as a greater sense of its responsibilities in preserving the peace and shaping the future, and the corresponding spread of U.S. policy-making agencies and legations around the globe.<br> <br>As the rewards of war failed to meet the impossibly high expectations, however, the euphoria had quickly faded. New fears about the nation&#x2019;s security had gripped the public. The tone of political debate in Congress grew sharply partisan and bitter, with the Republicans making the most of charges of Communist infiltration of the Truman administration, as though that could explain the failure to foresee what had happened with the Soviet Union and China. In the spring of 1947, in an effort to protect his administration, President Harry S. Truman established the Federal Employee Loyalty Program, a broad measure instituting background checks and screening procedures for all incumbent and prospective government employees. But instead of reassuring the public, the program helped legitimize the idea that international Communism posed a domestic threat. By the end of 1950, Alger Hiss was convicted of perjury, Klaus Fuchs confessed, and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were arrested on espionage charges of passing bomb secrets to the Russians. Inevitably, in 1953, after years of relentless media coverage, the Rosenbergs got the chair. All of this seemed to confirm the existence of spies in every nook and cranny of government. Washington was awash in paranoia and suspicion.<br> <br>Even more troubling than the hardening of ideology was the vicious Red-baiting of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy. To Julia, the whole government, spurred on by McCarthy&#x2019;s unscrupulous zeal, seemed consumed with hunting for subversives. Venting her anger in a letter to her family, Julia wrote that she could not help thinking that most McCarthy supporters, of whom she was afraid her &#x201c;dear old Pop&#x201d; was one, were &#x201c;good-hearted but fat-headed people&#x201d; who were hopelessly stuck in the past. For twenty years, her father&#x2019;s animosity had festered under the New Deal and the Fair Deal: &#x201c;Roosevelt was, to him, the anti-Christ. Roosevelt was socialism. The enemy. He boiled and seethed with hatred.&#x201d; As far as she could see, McCarthy had tapped right into that source of hatred, fueling people&#x2019;s fears about the future: &#x201c;Suddenly the new enemy is also Communism,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;It is these nasty foreigners with their socialistic ideas, these nasty intellectual egg-heads, who <i>like</i> the foreigners, &amp; who have always caused all the trouble. What we want is to return to 1925, when we had no world responsibility (presumably), and no truck with foreigners. We just want to live alone. McCarthy is the savior symbol.&#x201d;<br> <br>The junior senator from Wisconsin&#x2019;s rapid rise to power was a recurring theme in the newspapers and Julia and Paul were riveted. They read everything they could get their hands on in Bonn, including the <i>Herald Tribune</i> and an edited version of the daily <i>New York Times</i>, and they beseeched family members to send articles from home. McCarthy had successfully made Communism a potent campaign issue, and he bullied President Truman into implementing an executive order to begin loyalty investigations of government employees. After the &#x201c;fall&#x201d; of China in October 1949, when the Communists led by Mao Tse-tung proclaimed the formation of the People&#x2019;s Republic, McCarthy and his allies had stepped up their ideological attacks. On February 9, 1950, in a speech before the Women&#x2019;s Republican Club of Wheeling, West Virginia, McCarthy had announced his crusade against government employees suspected of being members of the Communist Party, who were nevertheless &#x201c;still working and shaping policy in the State Department.&#x201d; Julia and Paul had seen the headlines that followed, all of which focused on McCarthy&#x2019;s claim that he had in hand a &#x201c;list of 205&#x201d; names of traitors.<br> <br>McCarthy&#x2019;s Red scare became a real cause of concern, alarm even, to State Department personnel. He had made the overseas information agency one of his targets and had vowed to root out &#x201c;security risks.&#x201d; Hoping to appease McCarthy, President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x2019;s new secretary of state, John Foster Dulles, had dismissed a number of high-level diplomats and had warned that anything less than &#x201c;positive loyalty&#x201d; from Foreign Service officers was &#x201c;not tolerable at this time.&#x201d; Julia and Paul had been en route to Germany when they had heard about the flurry of coerced departures in Bonn. This had been followed by reports of books being removed from the shelves of libraries run by the USIS, known as America Houses, in a number of European cities. Dashiell Hammett&#x2019;s hard-boiled detective novel <i>The Maltese Falcon</i> was one of the many books McCarthy wanted &#x201c;deshelved&#x201d;&#x2014;a neat euphemism for censored. In Berlin, a book entitled <i>Thunder Out of China</i>, written by their friend Theodore H.

One of Paul&#x2019;s former colleagues, Larry Morris, the Paris cultural attach�, had happened on the two men in his office one Saturday afternoon, apparently making themselves at home with their feet propped up on his desk. Incensed, he had demanded they remove their feet from his desk and leave. They had gone quietly, but not before holding a press conference during which they made all sorts of unsubstantiated charges&#x2014;&#x201c;vague, but dirty,&#x201d; as Paul put it. Naturally, no official at the embassy was given the opportunity to reply. Then Cohn and Schine announced that the next day&#x2014;Easter Sunday&#x2014;they would be questioning the ambassador, and wanted to meet with all the top USIS officers at 3:00 p.m. that afternoon at the library to examine the books on display. Everyone canceled his or her holiday plans and assembled at the library at the appointed hour, but Cohn and Schine never showed.

Your last cookbook, <i>Real Cajun</i>, was a celebration of the culture in which you grew up. With <i>Down South</i>, what made you decide to get out of your comfort zone, so to speak?</b></p> <p>Growing up I had a strong influence from my Mother's father who grew up in Alabama. When it comes right down to it, I probably ate more Southern-style food growing up than Cajun food. We didn't take a lot of trips anywhere to speak of growing up except for to the Redneck Riviera. My aunt Cynthia had a house (trailer actually) on the waterfront in Gulf Shores, Alabama, so we would eat with her and at other funky restaurants on the Gulf Coast. I've also met a lot of other Southern chefs and have been able to see very distinct subcultures of southern food.</p> <p><b>Q. I know you routinely go to France and Italy, where you rent houses, shop the markets, and cook. And before you opened your fabulous new seafood restaurant P�che, you and your crew went to Spain and to Uruguay for inspiration. Tell us about how those experiences translate into the cooking you do in your restaurants and books. </b></p> <p>My favorite thing to do when I travel anywhere is to cook in those locations with their regional ingredients. People think I'm crazy to cook on vacation but I tell them that cooking is why I got into this business in the first place. It is actually one of my favorite things to do. There is no way to replicate the cooking from my house or even my restaurant. The ingredients, terroir, dairy, meats, etc., are all unique in different parts of the world with very unique flavors. Taste the butter in France or the meat in Uruguay and you'll immediately see what I mean. </p> <p><b>Q. You also travel a little closer to home--as in the places showcased in the new book. Tell us about the trips and the influences that inspired Down South. </b></p> <p>The Southern coast was probably the most inspiring of the trip. It's very difficult to find the old-school places that I remember growing up, but there are still a few. Most of the area has been taken over by some sort of crab-trap, generic-named restaurant serving frozen crab from Alaska. Just like the food overseas, the real finds on the Gulf Coast are the markets and the fresh seafood and making my own food with those ingredients. Burris Farm Market and Joe Patti's are great examples of this. </p> <p><b>Q. The subtitle of the new book references pork, shrimp, and bourbon, but there is clearly a whole lot more inside. What made you decided to pull those three ingredients out? </b></p> <p>When I first set out on this book, it occurred to me that most of my forays through the South involved some sort of pork and almost always ended up with bourbon, and on a few occasions the day started with bourbon. The shrimp part came after the great Gulf Coast trip. Whereas a lot of Southerners hunt religiously, my dad and I did a lot of fishing and shrimping. </p> <p><b>Q. This is a gorgeous book with stunning photographs. Why did you feel like it was important to shoot each chapter on location rather than in a studio? </b></p> <p>I've never been comfortable with studio shots. I don't feel it really represents the soul of the food I cook. Shooting on location with natural light always brings about a real and authentic sense of place to the food. The book is really telling a story about food. I think it would be hard to write about one's time in Spain if you've never been there. I feel the same about food and the photos that go with it. </p> <p><b>Q. It really feels like "Down South," to borrow your title, is really at the forefront (or maybe it's the engine) of the current national food scene--a trend driven in large part by remarkable chefs such as yourself. One of my favorite new restaurants in Manhattan, Maysville, is named for the town in Kentucky where bourbon was invented, and it has some of the best little grits cakes I've ever put in my mouth. The chef isn't Southern but his influence clearly is. First, do you agree that Southern cooking has moved to the front of the culinary pack? And if so, why do you think that is? </b></p> <p>For a long time, I think Southern food was considered a type of peasant fattening food. I think chefs now are seeing it's not all chitlins and cornbread. Southern food is, in my opinion, the most distinct food culture the United States has. It has a real history and a solid technique. I find the real trend going on right now is what is considered real. Early in my career at Herbsaint, I had moved back from a three-year stint cooking French California food in San Francisco and was hell bent on doing the same in New Orleans. I felt like the food I grew up with would never be received in an upscale dining situation. Then I came around and realized that cooking Southern and Cajun style was my God-given birthright, and there was no reason that I shouldn't let that come to the forefront of my cooking style. </p>DONALD LINK is the chef-owner of Herbsaint, Cochon, Cochon Butcher, P�che, and Calcasieu in New Orleans.

She didn&#x2019;t want him for herself or envy Jeanne (more than usual), but he cut a romantic figure, and Tess was not immune to romance, in spite of everything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He whipped off his cloak, tossed it toward a chair, and missed, but no matter. All eyes were upon his finely fitted maroon-�and-�gold doublet, his trunk hose, and his shiny, shiny boots. Or maybe his eyes, which smoldered at Jeanne from across the room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jeanne couldn&#x2019;t bear it. She squeaked and grew intent upon the shepherdess in her embroidery hoop. Tess sighed inwardly, praying her shy sister wouldn&#x2019;t spoil this opportunity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I heard Lord Chauncerat intended to ask for your hand,&#x201d; cried Lord Richard, clasping a fist to his chest. &#x201c;Am I too late?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So that was why he&#x2019;d come. Tess resumed her stitching with some satisfaction. Lord Chauncerat, of course, had made no proposal; he was a Daanite, uninterested in women, but he kept it secret. Tess had found out, or more accurately, something in his gaze had reminded her of Cousin Kenneth and she&#x2019;d guessed. For her silence, Lord Chauncerat had permitted her to take his name in vain and start the tiniest rumor that he might have a modicum of interest in Jeanne.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That was all it took at court. You put a copper coin in the gossip engine, every tongue polished it up, and it came out unrecognizably golden. By the time the rumor reached Lord Richard&#x2019;s ears, it would&#x2019;ve been inflated to ridiculous proportions. He&#x2019;d burst in as if expecting to interrupt the wedding itself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jeanne wasn&#x2019;t finding her voice. Tess bailed her out: &#x201c;Indeed, Lord Richard, you have arrived just in time.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His face lit up as if Jeanne herself had spoken, and not Jeanne&#x2019;s oracle at the other end of the couch. Tess didn&#x2019;t mind. She&#x2019;d have plunged her hand into her sister&#x2019;s back and moved her mouth like a ventriloquist&#x2019;s dummy&#x2019;s if that would have helped.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lord Richard crossed the room in three strides and dropped to one knee before Jeanne. The embroidery stand was in his way; Tess edged over and hooked it with her foot. Jeanne&#x2019;s eyes widened as the frame drifted away, leaving her no choice but to meet Lord Richard&#x2019;s eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She looked at her hands. Tess cursed silently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t that Jeanne didn&#x2019;t like this suitor; the problem was entirely that she did, rather a lot, and that she&#x2019;d been raised on the strictures of St. Vitt to keep her desires severely under wraps. It was devilishly hard to encompass both.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tess felt for her, but this was important.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lord Richard took Jeanne&#x2019;s hands&#x2014;�clever Richard!&#x2014;�and Jeanne looked up at last, flushing pink all over. She was beautiful even pink, Tess noted with some satisfaction. Richard seemed to think so, too, because he pressed her knuckles to his lips.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tess tried not to watch, even though she was supposed to be the chaperone, guaranteeing that nothing got out of hand. Privately she sort of wished things would get out of hand, just a little. It would have eased her heart to think that even pure, virginal Jeanne was a mere mortal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As if Lord Richard could read Tess&#x2019;s mind, he released Jeanne&#x2019;s hands and was back on his feet again, two yards of decency between them. Tess sighed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Jeanne,&#x201d; he said gruffly, his heart evidently in his throat, &#x201c;I want to marry you. Would you have a fellow like me?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A rich, handsome fellow who seemed utterly smitten with her? Unless she was terribly stupid. Tess snipped a stray thread with her scissors; she hadn&#x2019;t raised Jeanne to be stupid. She hadn&#x2019;t made every mistake she could possibly make, hadn&#x2019;t given everything up, so that Jeanne could sit there, saying nothing, as if she were stupid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Say yes, Nee,&#x201d; Tess mumbled around the needle between her teeth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jeanne rose, her green day dress draping demurely around her, and curtsied to Lord Richard. There should have been no suspense, but Tess found herself sweating all the same, her eyes glued to the duo, tall and dark facing short and pale. Lord Richard fidgeted with a button on his doublet, which Tess found humanizing and endearing. If Jeanne should turn him down, it was going to take a lot of looking to find another suitor half this well suited.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In a voice so sure and strong that Tess couldn&#x2019;t quite believe it was her sister speaking, Jeanne said, &#x201c;Lord Richard, I would happily accept your offer, but do you understand my family&#x2019;s situation? My father was unjustly stripped of his law license, and we&#x2019;ve struggled ever since. I should feel ashamed to put too great a burden on your house, and so I cannot agree to marry you without being certain you know how many obligations come with me.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tess&#x2019;s jaw dropped; this was not part of the script. That is, it was the truth&#x2014;�the family desperately needed Jeanne to marry for money&#x2014;�but it was nothing anyone would, or could or should, utter aloud. This was a game everyone played but no one acknowledged. Tess felt vaguely sick. She&#x2019;d worried that Jeanne would look too mercenary, and here was Jeanne herself, laying it all out on the table.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lord Richard, however, was smiling, and not a strained <i>what have I gotten myself into?</i> smile, but a smile full of warmth and gentleness that almost took Tess&#x2019;s breath away. &#x201c;My dear, there is no burden your family could place upon my house that we could not easily bear, or that I would not willingly take on for your sake.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Saints above, he was perfect. Jeanne deserved no less. How had they gotten so lucky? If Tess felt a self-�pitying pang for her own ill fortune, for Will and Dozerius and everything else she&#x2019;d lost, she suppressed the feeling almost before she noticed it. This was not the time; the moment was all Jeanne&#x2019;s, as was right.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jeanne, her courage spent, returned to her bashful, blushing self again. She stammered something adorably grateful; Richard, all passion, took her hands once more. He shot a glance at Tess, asking permission. Tess nodded curtly and turned her eyes resolutely to her hemming.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t keep them there. She peeked through her lashes and thought her heart would burst as Lord Richard chastely kissed Jeanne&#x2019;s cheek. Tess recalled such joys, even if she would never again experience them; indeed, she wanted more than that for Jeanne&#x2014;�he should kiss her lips at least!&#x2014;�but Lord Richard came from a devout household, as strict as theirs, and passion could not override his upbringing. Not today, anyway.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t linger, either, because it would not do to have tales told. One of Jeanne&#x2019;s great appeals, in the absence of money, was that she had not the faintest whiff of scandal about her. She was innocence incarnate. Lord Richard wouldn&#x2019;t compromise himself by compromising her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When he left, Jeanne turned toward her twin. Tess&#x2019;s smile froze when she realized her sister&#x2019;s eyes had filled with tears.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Dear heart, those are tears of joy, I hope?&#x201d; said Tess softly, holding out her hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jeanne flopped onto the couch and laid her head on Tess&#x2019;s shoulder, where she began to weep in earnest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tess set her sewing aside and put her arms around her sister, saying, &#x201c;No, no, why are you sad? If you dislike Lord Richard, we will find you someone else. Never mind the money, never mind how long it takes. Papa and Mama will find a way to send Paul to school. Seraphina will swoop in and fix everything&#x2014;�&#x201d; She wouldn&#x2019;t, in fact, because she couldn&#x2019;t, and Jeanne knew this as well as Tess did, but Tess felt it incumbent upon herself to keep her mouth moving, to keep her sister&#x2019;s spirits up. &#x201c;Something will come through for us. It always does.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jeanne drew her handkerchief out of her bodice and held it to her streaming nose. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not it, Sisi. I&#x2019;m happy to marry Richard. I believe I may be a bit in love with him.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tess drew herself up a little, taken aback. &#x201c;Whatever is the matter, then?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jeanne&#x2019;s cheeks were speckled like a rosy quail egg, her eyes rimmed in pink. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t help remembering that you&#x2019;re older than me, whatever we may pretend to the world. I don&#x2019;t deserve this honor and happiness, not when they should have been yours.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tess&#x2019;s heart contracted, wringing out the unselfish joy she&#x2019;d felt earlier. Wasn&#x2019;t this typical, though? Not only did Tess not get what should have been hers by birth, but now she had to comfort dear, tenderhearted Jeanne, who was upset by the unfairness of it. Tess did not often feel true resentment toward her sister, but in this moment she did. Soothing Jeanne&#x2019;s guilt, on top of everything else, seemed a bit much to ask.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;There, there,&#x201d; she said, patting her sister&#x2019;s back mechanically. &#x201c;We both know I&#x2019;ve gotten what I deserved. If I had really valued any of these things, surely I&#x2019;d have had the good sense not to throw them away.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jeanne sniffled and nodded. Tess turned her face away, unwilling to let her sister glimpse any anger in her eyes. It wasn&#x2019;t Jeanne&#x2019;s fault; every ounce of blame could be ascribed to Tess herself. Could be and should be. She ascribed it with all her might.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Only an ungrateful bitch of a sister could feel angry at dear, gentle Jeanne.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tess walked through the rest of her day, waiting on Lady Farquist, laughing at gentlemen&#x2019;s jokes during dinner, steering Jeanne&#x2019;s footsteps toward the obligatory soiree. Jeanne and Richard exchanged lingering glances across the room but said no more than a coy word to each other. Tess didn&#x2019;t care what they did; she was marking time until she could finally be alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Around midnight, Tess closed the door to her little room, which was technically a walk-�in closet; her &#x201c;elder&#x201d; sister got the suite&#x2019;s main boudoir. She fished around behind Jeanne&#x2019;s hanging gowns and three pairs of shoes and drew out a little bottle of plum brandy, which she&#x2019;d won off Lady Morena. She rationed the stuff religiously, because one never knew when it would be possible to obtain another, but tonight she filled her little glass three times. The fumes streaked painfully up her nose (plum brandy was not as delicious as it sounded), making her cough every time she exhaled, but she didn&#x2019;t mind. She flopped onto her cot, pleasantly dizzy, and joy was finally able to rise up in her again, a single bubble of hope.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After two years at court, diligently securing her sister&#x2019;s future, Tessie would be free.</p></p><h2>Movies As Literature Student Workbook</h2><p>A student workbook that goes along with MOVIES AS LITERATURE.</p><p>Kathryn Stout is a Christian educator, consultant, and speaker.

Entering the world of Raymond Washington with an open mind was difficult for me; however, the story of who Raymond Washington was as a leader, warrior, tactician, and mentor became clear. Learn why the gang was so successful and how an unremarkable fifteen-year-old kid in the fall of 1969 sat down with his best friend and formed what later became one of the most successful, and yet feared and hated gangs in the world&#x2014;the Crips.</p><p>Zach Fortier was a police officer for over thirty years specializing in K-9, SWAT, gangs, domestic violence, and sex crimes as an investigator.

Dostoyevsky's literary works explore human psychology in the troubled political, social and spiritual context of 19th-century Russian society. Although Dostoyevsky began writing books in the mid-1850s, his best remembered work was done in his last years, including Crime and Punishment, The Idiot and The Brothers Karamazov. He wrote eleven novels, three novellas, seventeen short novels and three essays and is often acknowledged by critics as one of the greatest and most prominent psychologists in world literature.</p><h2>Fixed Stars and Their Interpretation</h2><p>The basis for this book was a publication by Elsbeth Ebertin entitled Sternenwandel und Weltgeschehen. It contained cases of her own investigations and records. Her son, Reinhold Ebertin, and Georg Hoffman, Elsbeth&#39;s coworker, edited the text and added many new sources of information. Like Ptolemy&#39;s astronomical handbook, Almagest, this is the basis for much of the current information on fixed stars. Modern astrologers recognized that fixed stars carry an influence into the horoscope if conjunction a natal planet by longitude and even more so if by latitude. A prominent star on the Ascendant or Midheaven is said to be an indication of recognition achieved in the lifetime. The character of the star indicates the kind of influence the aspect will have. This book contains 73 major stars and describes their essential nature.</p><p></p><h2>The Natural History of Big Sur (Volume 57) (California Natural History Guides)</h2><p>Each year millions of people visit the area of rugged California coastline and wild mountains known as Big Sur. Finally here is a book that is both a natural history of this beautiful region and an excellent guide to its extensive public lands. The first section introduces the area's geology, climate, flora, fauna, and human history. The second section describes selected sites, trails, and features that are mentioned in Part One.<br><br>Although Big Sur is world famous for awe-inspiring scenery, it is less known for its great ecological diversity and its significance as a haven for many species of terrestrial and marine wildlife. In no other part of the world do fog-loving coastal redwoods thrive on one slope of a canyon while arid-climate yuccas grow on the other. Similarly, sea otters and cormorants live near dry-climate creatures like canyon wrens and whiptail lizards. The area's staggering beauty and forbidding wilderness have inspired artists, poets, naturalists, and hikers&#x2015;and also real estate developers.<br><br>As increasing tourism, development pressure, and land-use decisions continue to affect Big Sur, this book will do much to heighten awareness of the region's biotic richness and fragility. Written in nontechnical language, with generous color photographs, drawings, maps, species lists, and a bibliography, it will attract both the casual and the serious naturalist, as well as anyone concerned about preserving California's natural heritage.</p><p>Each year millions of people visit the rugged California coastline and wild mountains known as Big Sur.

They are so crippled by their guilt, by their unreasonable expectations, that they can&#x2019;t even allow themselves to celebrate the true joys of being a mom. When your little girl curls up in bed with you and says, &#x201c;Your hair always smells so good, Mama,&#x201d; you should be able to melt with emotion without worrying about whether she&#x2019;s reading at grade level.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Do you think you&#x2019;re a bad mother?</p> <p><b>AW:</b> Well, yes. Of course. I mean, that&#x2019;s the whole problem. I feel like a bad mother, even when by all reasonable analysis I&#x2019;m a perfectly fine mother. Hell, I went camping last month with the second grade. Camping. Me. A Jewish American Princess from New Jersey. Camping for me is staying in a Marriott, but I slept on the ground and ate toast burned over an open fire. And had fun. </p> <p><b>Q:</b> What is your definition of a good mother?</p> <p><b>AW:</b> As one of my interview subjects said, &#x201c;A Good Mother remembers to serve fruit at breakfast, is always cheerful and never yells, manages not to project her own neuroses and inadequacies onto her children, is an active and beloved community volunteer. She remembers to make playdates, her children's clothes fit, she does art projects with them and enjoys all their games. And she is never too tired for sex.&#x201d;</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Okay, so what do you consider the responsible, attainable ideal of a modern mother?</p> <p><b>AW:</b> One who loves her kids and does her level best not to damage them in any permanent way. A good mother doesn&#x2019;t let herself be overcome by guilt when she screws up.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> How did your upbringing shape you as a mother?</p> <p><b>AW:</b> My mother drilled into me the importance of being a feminist, a woman with her own identity. But perhaps more important, she and my dad modeled a relationship that was entirely unequal... and didn&#x2019;t work. I knew I wanted something different from what they had. So while I&#x2019;ve made choices that made her feminist blood boil, I&#x2019;ve also expected that my husband pull his share of the home and child labor. And that&#x2019;s made all the difference.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> What advice would you give to mothers, today?</p> <p><b>AW:</b> Most important, learn to forgive yourself and the other mothers you know. Try to lay off the judgment. Just do your best and consider the rest a small donation on your part to therapists the world over. If we never messed up, what would they charge our children for?</p> <p><b>Q:</b> So what's the snarky answer to why you wrote <i>Bad Mother</i>?</p> <p><b>AW:</b> As a kind of f*** you to the insane Urban-Baby type moms who, after my <i>New York Times</i> piece on loving my husband more than my kids, sent me letters saying my children should be taken away from me and/or my husband would leave me for another woman. And especially to the woman on Oprah who leapt across the stage shouting, &#x201c;Let me at her!&#x201d; when I walked on that set.

"I even like the parts most people hate--shopping in crowded malls and reading Christmas newsletters and seeing relatives and standing in baggage check-in lines at the airport. Okay, I lied. Nobody likes standing in baggage check-in lines," she writes. Willis knows it's <i>hard</i> to write good Christmas stories: the subject matter is limited, the writer has to balance between sentiment and skepticism, and too many fall into the Victorian habit of killing off saintly children and poor people. Here she presents eight marvelous Christmas tales, two of which appear for the first time.<p> The stories range from "The Pony," about a psychotherapist who doesn't believe that Christmas gifts can answer our deepest longings, and "Inn," in which a choir member rehearsing for the Christmas pageant becomes part of the original Christmas story, to "Newsletter," where an invasion of parasitic creatures causes unusually good behavior in their hosts, and "Epiphany," a story of three unlikely Magi following signs through a North American winter toward the returned Jesus Christ. "Miracle" is a comic romance echoing Willis's favorite Yuletide movie, <i>Miracle on 34th Street</i>, and "Catspaw" is a homage to the traditional Christmas murder mystery with a sly, science-fictional twist. The collection also includes "In Coppelius' Toyshop," in which a bad guy is trapped in Toyland, and "Adaptation," a Dickensian story about what it means to keep Christmas in your heart.</p><p> Those who want only SF stories may find this collection lacking, but anyone who enjoys complex tales with true Christmas spirit will treasure it. <i>--Nona Vero</i></p>"The witty, literate Willis offers to wonderfully enjoyable ode to Christmas."<br>--Publishers Weekly<br><br>"When the holidays seem too stressful, pick up Miracle and Other Christmas Stories, slow down, read a few and remember what the holiday is all about."<br>--The Denver Post<br><br>"Gives occasion for even hardened Scrooges to rejoice, as usual, in Connie Willis."<br>--Boolist<br><br>""Willis is a national treasure."<br>--San Antonio Express-News<br></p><h2>A Roomful of Hovings and Other Profiles</h2><p><p>In this unique book, John McPhee takes us into the world of several fascinating people.

Hoving stood somewhere near the Short Portly rack in the John David clothing store at 608 Fifth Avenue. He wore a double-breasted sharkskin suit, with a fresh flower in his lapel. On his face was a prepared smile. He was a floorwalker. This was the summer of 1950, and he was nineteen years old. "May I help you, sir?" Hoving would say to almost anyone who came through the door. "I'd like to see Mr. Card." "Card! See-You!" Hoving called out, and Mr. Card, a master salesman, sprang forward. See-Yous were people who asked for specific clerks. Otherwise, customers were taken in rotation. It was not unknown in that era for clothing salesmen to slip substantial honoraria tofloorwalkers to get them in the habit of turning non-See-Yous into See Yous. But Hoving was unbribable. He had learned that every salesman recurrently dreams of a rich Brazilian who--when it happens to be the dreamer's turn to wait on him--wilt walk into the store and order fifty-five suits. Hoving would do nothing that might spoil this dream. The door opens again, and a tall, slim, wilted-looking man enters the store and dispiritedly examines a display of ties; then he crosses to the rack of 42 Regulars and begins to finger the sleeves of the suits. This man is a Cooler. His constitution has just been defeated by the incredible heat outside, and he has come into the store to recover. Hoving is merciless. He says, "May I help you, sir?" "Just looking," the Cooler says. "Sir, you don't belong in this section," Hoving says. "You are a 39 Extra-Long." To show Coolers what they were up against, Hoving would lead them directly to the area of the Hickey-Freeman suits--the best in the store, one hundred and twenty-five dollars and up. Hoving's idea of a summer place was Edgartown, on Martha's Vineyard. He hated this job--or, more precisely, he hated the idea of it--but it was apparently designed by his father as a part of a program of training, for his father, Walter Hoving, who was then president of Bonwit Teller and is now chairman of Tiffany &amp; Co., happened to own, as well, the John David chain of stores. Young Hoving learned a lot there. He could fold a suit and wrap it in ten seconds; he also noticed that prostitutes who came into the store generally hunted for contacts along the suit racks, while homosexuals used the shoe department. Every lunchtime, all summer long, he went to the Forty-second Street Horn &amp; Hardart and ate the same meal--hamburger, mashed potatoes, and a ball of chocolate ice cream. When Hoving, after a brilliant year as City Parks Commissioner, had just become (at the age of thirty-six) Director of theMetropolitan Museum of Art, he reflected, one day, on the John David summer. "Mr. Card and Mr. Mintz were important influences on my life as a floorwalker," he said. "They told me, 'Don't buckle in. Do it honest. Only schnookers will ask to be brought out of rotation. The rich Brazilian will come to every man in his lifetime.'" Hoving said that he had not believed in the rich Brazilian until a day when one came in. "He bought twenty Hickey-Freeman suits," Hoving recalled. "The young salesman who had him was going bo-bo. Around the first of August, that summer, I began to get the ague from standing on my feet all the time. The man we all worked for was called Colonel Ladue. He had owned the chain before my father did, and had been retained to run it. You had to call him 'Colonel' or he'd get disturbed. You <i>know</i> what kind of a guy that is. He had an adder's glance--without a nod, without a smile, without a crinkle of the eye. That summer killed me on the mercantile business." EDGARTOWN Hoving in Edgartown, in the summers of his adolescence, was a part of what he describes as "a wild bicycle set, semirichies, cultured Hell's Angels of that period." They had names like Grant McCargo, Dikey Duncan, and David Erdman, and they numbered up to fifteen or twenty, with girls included. Hoving was not the leader; he could apparently take or leave everybody. Nonetheless, he was thought of by some of his friends' mothers, though they seldom had anything really gross or specific to cite, as the sort of boy who was probably a corrupting influence on their children. He went out with a scalloper's daughter. His family didn't give him much money--never more than two dollars a week--so he washedcars, worked in a bicycle-repair shop, painted sailboats, caddied for golfers, and set pins in a bowling alley. Sailing races were the main preoccupation of the pack, and Hoving was always a crewman, never a skipper--in part, he says, because he never had a skipper's feel for the wind and the sea, and in part because he never owned a boat. All the boys wore blue or white button-down shirts. Hoving had both kinds, too, but he also appeared in patterned sports shirts, which were an emblem of immeasurable outness. He didn't care. Everybody wore a stopwatch around his neck, for the racing. One day, when the boys were fifteen, they discovered another use for the stopwatches. Grant McCargo bought a case of ale--"local poison, eighteen cents a can"--and, as Hoving continues it, "we all went into the graveyard and sat on friendly stones; we had shot glasses, and every thirty seconds everybody drank a shot of the ale until we were completely zonked." He played tennis barefoot, and his idea of real action was a long, cool ride in the breakers. "Great! Great!" he would say when he felt an impulse for the surf. "Let's go out to Barnhouse Beach and get boiled in the rollers." When he went to the beach, he took books along, in his bicycle basket, and he read them while he was lying in the sun recovering from the rollers. Robert Goldman, who later roomed with Hoving at Princeton and is now a writer of musical plays, was an occasional visitor to Edgartown in the years when Hoving was there. "He had a precocity typical of New York kids," Goldman remembers. "You know, you leap right from childhood into being twenty-one. Tommy was always hip, always absorbed with upper bohemia. He made newspapery references. He was the first person I ever heard use the word 'great' in that special sense. Everything was 'great.' I went to Edgartown uninvited once, and I was pretty much on the outside of things, and a situation came up one day when Hoving said, about me, 'Hey, let him play.' I've never forgotten it. He was an unaffectedcity kid, with spirit to him. He never made me feel like an intruder. Some of the others did." Hoving clowned and joked a lot, and he haunted an empty house once with Dikey Duncan (using sheets, chains, and foghorns) until the police put a stop to it, but he was actually quite shy, and he felt sure that he was not at all popular. One index of popularity in Edgartown, however, was the number of bicycles that could be found stacked outside one's house, and wherever Hoving was living was where the biggest stack of bicycles was. To be sure, this was in part because of the warm personality, unfailing generosity, and utter permissiveness of his mother, who was apparently neither as staid nor as consciously social as most of the other parents in Edgartown, and whose house (always a rented one) was a sanctuary for young people from discipline of any kind. She had been divorced from Tom's father when Tom was five years old. Her name was--she died in 1954--Mary Osgood Field Hoving, her nickname was Peter, and she was a descendant of Samuel Osgood, the first Postmaster General of the United States. Her father, Tom's grandfather, was such a fastidious man that he kept a diary of the clothes he wore. His wife left him, and from the age of two Tom's mother was brought up by an aunt. She married Walter Hoving when she was a debutante, pretty and blond, a cutout exemplar of the girl of the nineteen-twenties. Although she never married again, men were always attracted to her in clusters, and--according to Nancy Hoving, Tom Hoving's wife--"old half successes with moon in their eyes still ask about her." Some of her friends would act, on occasion, as surrogate fathers to Tom and his older sister Petrea, or Petie, turning up at child functions where parents are supposed to appear. Both Tom and his mother had strong tempers, and the two of them would sometimes have conflagrationary fights. Friends once came upon them sitting in a doorway in Edgartown together, weeping. Tomeventually learned not to participate--to act, when something unpleasant came up, as if it weren't there. (This is a faculty he is said to have kept.) His mother's emotions sometimes overflowed in the opposite direction as well, and the more demonstrative she was toward him, apparently, the more he pulled away, developing a general aloofness that characterized him for some years--until he was ready to take part in things on his own terms. Remembering himself at Edgartown, he once said, "I'm sure the other mothers thought, Poor Peter, with a son like that! I was pretty scrawny, unco�rdinated, and slovenly." He fought constantly with his sister (he once pushed her out on a roof and locked the window), but he was unusually close to her--they were two years apart in age--and he has named his only daughter Petrea for her. His particular friend was Dikey Duncan, whose family held the Lea &amp; Perrin's Worcestershire Sauce franchise in the United States. Hoving and Duncan had the same attitude, according to Hoving's description: "Cool. We cooled it, you know. The same thoughts came to us. Dikey was bland, thin, and wiry, and he had a delightful irresponsible touch. We all used to go out to South Beach and play capture-the-flag, then sit around a great fire and get zonked. Dikey, who liked whiskey, would suck away at this bottle of Black Death. Everybody else drank Seabreezes. There were periods of forty days when we were never not drunk in the evening. One night, Dikey shambled down to the yacht club and insulted many parents, and our introduction to booze came to a grinding halt." Grant McCargo had a car (something Hoving never had), and the others would monitor McCargo's speed with their stopwatches, having determined beforehand the distances between various landmarks on the island. McCargo, as Hoving remembers him, was a silent young man who was very much worth listening to when he spoke, and his favorite object was aWright &amp; Ditson tennis-ball can, from which he drank his Seabreezes. ("He was always getting fuzz in his mouth, and the drinks tasted of rubber.") With the tennis-ball can in one hand and the steering wheel in the other, McCargo used to drive all the way across Martha's Vineyard at night with the headlights turned off, while Hoving, Duncan, and additional passengers assessed his progress with their stopwatches. Hoving's Edgartown era came to an end after a beach party. The pack turned over a large sand-moving machine and set its fuel tank ablaze. Hoving caught the next ferry for the mainland, and he has never been back to Edgartown. With a mixture of shame and dramaturgy, he has always claimed that he can never go back, because the rap for the sand-moving machine is on him still. He is a lover of intrigue, secrecy, and mystery, and he sometimes finds shadows more interesting than the objects that cast them. He could, of course, go back to Edgartown, but not as a boy, and that is probably what he actually means. David Erdman, the skipper whom Hoving served as crewman summer after summer, cannot remember that Hoving in Edgartown gave even the faintest of hints of the future that awaited him. "He showed no artistic inclinations at all," Erdman said recently. "If I had been told that he would eventually be the Director of the Metropolitan Museum, I would have laughed and laughed and said, 'You've got to be kidding.'" RORIMER In the spring of 1959, when Hoving was a graduate student in art history at Princeton, he gave a lecture at an annual symposium at the Frick Collection, in New York, on certain antique sources of the Annibale Carracci frescoes in the Farnese Gallery, in Rome. The symposium was known among graduatestudents as "the meat market"--a place where the young are examined by experienced eyes from museums, galleries, and universities, and where futures can be made or ruined. Hoving's palms had been damp for weeks. He feared, among other things, the presence of Erica Tietze-Conrat, an art scholar who attended the symposium unfailingly and had been known to stand up in the middle of a young man's reading and shout, in a martial Wagnerian accent, "Youl Are! Wrong!" Hoving, acting on a reasonable guess, had found unmistakable similarities between ancient sculptures in the National Museum in Naples and figures in the Carracci frescoes in the Farnese. He had learned that the sculptures now in Naples were actually housed in the Farnese Palace when Carracci was doing his work there, and this was the gist of what he presented at the symposium, in a twenty-minute talk illustrated with slides. Erica Tietze-Conrat did not interrupt him, and when he had finished she applauded strongly. "A few moments later," as Hoving continues, "a man, 39 Short Portly, whom I didn't know, came up to me and asked if, in my work on the Farnese Gallery, I had encountered records of a large sixteenth-century marble table inlaid with semiprecious stones that had once been in the center of the gallery. I said I did not remember seeing anything about such a table, and he asked if I had time to have a look at it, since he happened to have it. I said sure. I had no idea who the man was, and I guess he assumed that I knew. He had deep, deep, penetrating, steady brown eyes that didn't blink. He led me out onto Fifth Avenue and a number of blocks north, up to the Metropolitan Museum. We went in at the Eighty-first Street entrance and up the stairs to the office of the Director, and by then I had figured out that he must be the Director, but, to tell you the truth, I had no idea who the Director of the Metropolitan Museum <i>was</i>. So I kept sidling around his desk while he talked--trying to get a look into his 'in' box, you know--and finally I saw his name, James J. Rorimer." After they had looked over the marble table, which is now in the center of a room full of Italian Renaissance paintings, Rorimer asked Hoving what he was going to do when he left graduate school. Hoving said that he thought he might work in a gallery and that he had already been interviewed by George Wildenstein and a man at Knoedler's. "Really?" Rorimer said. "I'm surprised. Go to a dealer and you'll never work at any museum in the United States. Go to a museum and you can later work, if you like, at any dealer's shop in the world." Rorimer invited Hoving to come into the city and have lunch with him each Wednesday for a while, and Hoving did. Later that year, Hoving went to work for the Museum, at an annual salary of five thousand and five dollars. He soon became a curatorial assistant in the Museum's Medieval Department and at The Cloisters, and one of his first assignments was to write a letter of declination to a New York dealer who had offered for sale, in a letter with a photograph, a twenty-four-by-twenty-six-inch marble Romanesque relief that was then somewhere in Italy. In a margin of the dealer's letter Rorimer had written, "Not for us." The photograph looked so interesting to Hoving that he asked his superiors in the Medieval Department if he could study the relief for a while before writing to the dealer. He was told, with fatherly u...</p><h2>Identity Theft: How Jesus Was Robbed Of His Jewishness</h2><p><p><b>Has the Messiah been robbed?</b></p><p>Supernatural visitations. Divine time travel.

The book's principle figure is Valdemar's most powerful herald, Laven Firestorm, who comes of age during Valdemar's war with its long-time enemy, the kingdom of Karse.<p> Sixteen-year-old Laven Chitward's world is turned upside down when his mother is selected as a textile guild representative in the small rural community where he was raised. Moving to the capital city of Haven rips him away from his friends and boyhood pleasures, and nothing in Haven seems to fill that void. Unable to fit into the nouveau riche society, and unwilling to follow his parents into the textile guild, he finds himself adrift and depressed. His father enrolls him in a special school that will allow him to choose a trade that interests him, rather than be apprenticed against his will.

In this book, Stokes expresses a deep respect for science, but like the best scientists themselves, is carefully skeptical about the idea that science is our final gateway to truth. He also argues that despite all recent claims to the contrary, morality does not make sense without God. The book deals with some highly technical matters in a learned way, but with wit and clarity.

I grew up with my younger sister, Lucille, under the care of my grandmother, Mrs. Sylvia Foster, and when she died, of her sisters-in-law, Misses Lily and Nona Foster, and when they fled, of her daughter, Mrs. Sylvia Fisher. Through all these generations of elders we lived in one house, my grandmother&#x2019;s house, built for her by her husband, Edmund Foster, an employee of the railroad, who escaped this world years before I entered it. It was he who put us down in this unlikely place. He had grown up in the Middle West, in a house dug out of the ground, with windows just at earth level and just at eye level, so that from without, the house was a mere mound, no more a human stronghold than a grave, and from within, the perfect horizontality of the world in that place foreshortened the view so severely that the horizon seemed to circumscribe the sod house and nothing more. So my grandfather began to read what he could find of travel literature, journals of expeditions to the mountains of Africa, to the Alps, the Andes, the Himalayas, the Rockies. He bought a box of colors and copied a magazine lithograph of a Japanese painting of Fujiyama. He painted many more mountains, none of them identifiable, if any of them were real. They were all suave cones or mounds, single or in heaps or clusters, green, brown, or white, depending on the season, but always snowcapped, these caps being pink, white, or gold, depending on the time of day. In one large painting he had put a bell-shaped mountain in the very foreground and covered it with meticulously painted trees, each of which stood out at right angles to the ground, where it grew exactly as the nap stands out on folded plush. Every tree bore bright fruit, and showy birds nested in the boughs, and every fruit and bird was plumb with the warp in the earth. Oversized beasts, spotted and striped, could be seen running unimpeded up the right side and un-hastened down the left. Whether the genius of this painting was ignorance or fancy I never could decide.<br>One spring my grandfather quit his subterraneous house, walked to the railroad, and took a train west. He told the ticket agent that he wanted to go to the mountains, and the man arranged to have him put off here, which may not have been a malign joke, or a joke at all, since there are mountains, uncountable mountains, and where there are not mountains there are hills. The terrain on which the town itself is built is relatively level, having once belonged to the lake. It seems there was a time when the dimensions of things modified themselves, leaving a number of puzzling margins, as between the mountains as they must have been and the mountains as they are now, or between the lake as it once was and the lake as it is now. Sometimes in the spring the old lake will return. One will open a cellar door to wading boots floating tallowy soles up and planks and buckets bumping at the threshold, the stairway gone from sight after the second step. The earth will brim, the soil will become mud and then silty water, and the grass will stand in chill water to its tips. Our house was at the edge of town on a little hill, so we rarely had more than a black pool in our cellar, with a few skeletal insects skidding around on it. A narrow pond would form in the orchard, water clear as air covering grass and black leaves and fallen branches, all around it black leaves and drenched grass and fallen branches, and on it, slight as an image in an eye, sky, clouds, trees, our hovering faces and our cold hands.<br>My grandfather had a job with the railroad by the time he reached his stop. It seems he was befriended by a conductor of more than ordinary influence. The job was not an especially good one. He was a watchman, or perhaps a signalman. At any rate, he went to work at nightfall and walked around until dawn, carrying a lamp. But he was a dutiful and industrious worker, and bound to rise. In no more than a decade he was supervising the loading and unloading of livestock and freight, and in another six years he was assistant to the stationmaster. He held this post for two years, when, as he was returning from some business in Spokane, his mortal and professional careers ended in a spectacular derailment.<br>Though it was reported in newspapers as far away as Denver and St. Paul, it was not, strictly speaking, spectacular, because no one saw it happen. The disaster took place midway through a moonless night. The train, which was black and sleek and elegant, and was called the Fireball, had pulled more than halfway across the bridge when the engine nosed over toward the lake and then the rest of the train slid after it into the water like a weasel sliding off a rock. A porter and a waiter who were standing at the railing at the rear of the caboose discussing personal matters (they were distantly related) survived, but they were not really witnesses in any sense, for the equally sound reasons that the darkness was impenetrable to any eye and that they had been standing at the end of the train looking back.<br>People came down to the water&#x2019;s edge, carrying lamps. Most of them stood on the shore, where in time they built a fire. But some of the taller boys and younger men walked out on the railroad bridge with ropes and lanterns. Two or three covered themselves with black grease and tied themselves up in rope harnesses, and the others lowered them down into the water at the place where the porter and the waiter thought the train must have disappeared. After two minutes timed on a stopwatch, the ropes were pulled in again and the divers walked stiff-legged up the pilings, were freed from their ropes and wrapped in blankets. The water was perilously cold.<br>Till it was dawn the divers swung down from the bridge and walked, or were dragged, up again. A suitcase, a seat cushion, and a lettuce were all they retrieved. Some of the divers remembered pushing past debris as they swam down into the water, but the debris must have sunk again, or drifted away in the dark. By the time they stopped hoping to find passengers, there was nothing else to be saved, no relics but three, and one of them perishable. They began to speculate that this was not after all the place where the train left the bridge. There were questions about how the train would move through the water. Would it sink like a stone despite its speed, or slide like an eel despite its weight? If it did leave the tracks here, perhaps it came to rest a hundred feet ahead. Or again it might have rolled or slid when it struck bottom, since the bridge pilings were set in the crest of a chain of flooded hills, which on one side formed the wall of a broad valley (there was another chain of hills twenty miles north, some of them islands) and on the other side fell away in cliffs. Apparently these hills were the bank of still another lake, and were made of some brittle stone which had been mined by the water and fallen sheerly away. If the train had gone over on the south side (the testimony of the porter and the waiter was that it had, but by this time they were credited very little) and had slid or rolled once or twice, it might have fallen again, farther and much longer.<br>After a while some of the younger boys came out on the bridge and began to jump off, at first cautiously and then almost exuberantly, with whoops of fear. When the sun rose, clouds soaked up the light like a stain. It became colder. The sun rose higher, and the sky grew bright as tin. The surface of the lake was very still. As the boys&#x2019; feet struck the water, there was a slight sound of rupture. Fragments of transparent ice wobbled on the waves they made and, when the water was calm again, knitted themselves up like bits of a reflection. One of the boys swam out forty feet from the bridge and then down to the old lake, feeling his way down the wall, down the blind, breathless stone, headfirst, and then pushing out from the foot. But the thought of where he was suddenly terrified him, and he leaped toward the air, brushing something with his leg as he did. He reached down and put his hand on a perfectly smooth surface, parallel to the bottom, but, he thought, seven or eight feet above it. A window. The train had landed on its side. He could not reach it a second time. The water bore him up. He said only that smooth surface, of all the things he touched, was not overgrown or hovered about by a cloud of something loose, like silt. This boy was an ingenious liar, a lonely boy with a boundless desire to ingratiate himself. His story was neither believed nor disbelieved.<br>By the time he had swum back to the bridge and was pulled up and had told the men there where he had been, the water was becoming dull and opaque, like cooling wax. Shivers flew when a swimmer surfaced, and the membrane of ice that formed where the ice was torn looked new, glassy, and black. All the swimmers came in. By evening the lake there had sealed itself over.<br>This catastrophe left three new widows in Fingerbone: my grandmother, and the wives of two elderly brothers who owned a dry-goods store. These two old women had lived in Fingerbone thirty years or more, but they left, one to live with a married daughter in North Dakota and the other to find any friends or kin in Sewickley, Pennsylvania, which she had left as a bride. They said they could no longer live by the lake. They said the wind smelled of it, and they could taste it in the drinking water, and they could not abide the smell, the taste, or the sight of it. They did not wait for the memorial service and rearing of the commemorative stone, when scores of mourners and sightseers, led by three officers of the railroad, walked out on the bridge between handrails mounted for the occasion, and dropped wreaths on the ice.<br>It is true that one is always aware of the lake in Fingerbone, or the deeps of the lake, the lightless, airless waters below. When the ground is plowed in the spring, cut and laid open, what exhales from the furrows but that same, sharp, watery smell. The wind is watery, and all the pumps and creeks and ditches smell of water unalloyed by any other element. At the foundation is the old lake, which is smothered and nameless and altogether black. Then there is Fingerbone, the lake of charts and photographs, which is permeated by sunlight and sustains green life and innumerable fish, and in which one can look down in the shadow of a dock and see stony, earthy bottom, more or less as one sees dry ground. And above that, the lake that rises in the spring and turns the grass dark and coarse as reeds. And above that the water suspended in sunlight, sharp as the breath of an animal, which brims inside this circle of mountains.<br>It seems that my grandmother did not consider leaving. She had lived her whole life in Fingerbone. And though she never spoke of it, and no doubt seldom thought of it, she was a religious woman. That is to say that she conceived of life as a road down which one traveled, an easy enough road through a broad country, and that one&#x2019;s destination was there from the very beginning, a measured distance away, standing in the ordinary light like some plain house where one went in and was greeted by respectable people and was shown to a room where everything one had ever lost or put aside was gathered together, waiting. She accepted the idea that at some time she and my grandfather would meet and take up their lives again, without the worry of money, in a milder climate. She hoped that he would somehow have acquired a little more stability and common sense. With him this had so far not been an effect of age, and she distrusted the idea of transfiguration. The bitter thing about his death, since she had a house and a pension and the children were almost grown, was that it seemed to her a kind of defection, not altogether unanticipated. How many times had she waked in the morning to find him gone? And sometimes for whole days he would walk around singing to himself in a thin voice, and speak to her and his children as a very civil man would speak to strangers. And now he had vanished finally. When they were reunited, she hoped he would be changed, substantially changed, but she did not set her heart on it. Musing thus, she set out upon her widowhood, and became altogether as good a widow as she had been a wife.<br>After their father&#x2019;s death, the girls hovered around her, watched everything she did, followed her through the house, got in her way. Molly was sixteen that winter; Helen, my mother, was fifteen; and Sylvie was thirteen. When their mother sat down with her mending, they would settle themselves around her on the floor, trying to be comfortable, with their heads propped against her knees or her chair, restless as young children. They would pull fringe off the rug, pleat her hem, pummel one another sometimes, while they talked indolently about school or worked out the endless minor complaints and accusations that arose among them. After a while they would turn on the radio and start brushing Sylvie&#x2019;s hair, which was light brown and heavy and hung down to her waist. The older girls were expert at building it into pompadours with ringlets at ear and nape. Sylvie crossed her legs at the ankles and read magazines. When she got sleepy she would go off to her room and take a nap, and come down to supper with her gorgeous hair rumpled and awry. Nothing could induce vanity in her.<br>When suppertime came, they would follow their mother into the kitchen, set the table, lift the lids off the pans. And then they would sit around the table and eat together, Molly and Helen fastidious, Sylvie with milk on her lip. Even then, in the bright kitchen with white curtains screening out the dark, their mother felt them leaning toward her, looking at her face and her hands.<br>Never since they were small children had they clustered about her so, and never since then had she been so aware of the smell of their hair, their softness, breathiness, abruptness. It filled her with a strange elation, the same pleasure she had felt when any one of them, as a sucking child, had fastened her eyes on her face and reached for her other breast, her hair, her lips, hungry to touch, eager to be filled for a while and sleep.<br>She had always known a thousand ways to circle them all around with what must have seemed like grace. She knew a thousand songs. Her bread was tender and her jelly was tart, and on rainy days she made cookies and applesauce. In the summer she kept roses in a vase on the piano, huge, pungent roses, and when the blooms ripened and the petals fell, she put them in a tall Chinese jar, with cloves and thyme and sticks of cinnamon. Her children slept on starched sheets under layers of quilts, and in the morning her curtains filled with light the way sails fill with wind. Of course they pressed her and touched her as if she had just returned after an absence. Not because they were afraid she would vanish as their father had done, but because his sudden vanishing had made them aware of her.<br>When she had been married a little while, she concluded that love was half a longing of a kind that possession did nothing to mitigate. Once, while they were still childless, Edmund had found a pocket watch on the shore. The case and the crystal were undamaged, but the works were nearly consumed by rust. He opened the watch and emptied it, and where the face had been he fitted a circle of paper on which he had painted two seahorses. He gave it to her as a pendant, with a chain through it, but she hardly ever wore it because the chain was too short to allow her to look at the seahorses comfortably. She worried that it would be damaged on her belt or in her pocket. For perhaps a week she carried the watch wherever she went, even across the room, and it was not because Edmund had made it for her, or because the painting was less vivid and awkward than ...</p><h2>A Year With the Angels</h2><p><p>In his previous release, you were invited to a year-long retreat with the Church Fathers; now, Mike Aquilina presents a new volume of contemplations and prayers about those most mysterious of all created beings: the Angels.</p> <p>Drawing again from the deep well of the Fathers' wisdom, Aquilina has compiled a year's worth of reflections on the Nine Choirs of Angels.</p> <p><em>A Year With the Angels</em> invites you to discover the authority and strength of the Heavenly Host.

This book is their collective biography--a history of their family and work lives, and of their union. Out of the labor militancy of the 1930s emerged the United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing, and Allied Workers of America (UCAPAWA). Quickly it became the seventh largest CIO affiliate and a rare success story of women in unions.</p><p>Thousands of Mexican and Mexican-American women working in canneries in southern California established effective, democratic trade union locals run by local members. These rank-and-file activists skillfully managed union affairs, including negotiating such benefits as maternity leave, company-provided day care, and paid vacations--in some cases better benefits than they enjoy today. But by 1951, UCAPAWA lay in ruins--a victim of red baiting in the McCarthy era and of brutal takeover tactics by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.</p></p><p>This dramatic and turbulent history of UCAPAWA is a major contribution to the new labor history in its carefully documented account of minority women controlling their union and regulating their working lives.Vicki L Ruiz</p><h2>Nightmare At 20,000 Feet: Horror Stories By Richard Matheson</h2><p><p>Remember that monster on the wing of the airplane? William Shatner saw it on The Twilight Zone, John Lithgow saw it in the movie-even Bart Simpson saw it. "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet" is just one of many classic horror stories by Richard Matheson that have insinuated themselves into our collective imagination.</p><p>Here are more than twenty of Matheson's most memorable tales of fear and paranoia, including:</p><p>"Duel," the nail-biting tale of man versus machines that inspired Steven Spielberg's first film;</p><p>"Prey," in which a terrified woman is stalked by a malevolent Tiki doll, as chillingly captured in yet another legendary TV moment;</p><p>"Blood Son," a disturbing portrait of a strange little boy who dreams of being a vampire;</p><p>"Dress of White Silk," a seductively sinister tale of evil and innocence.</p><p>Personally selected by Richard Matheson, the bestselling author of <i>I Am Legend</i> and <i>What Dreams May Come</i>, these and many other stories, more than demonstrate why he is rightfully regarded as one of the finest and most influential horror writers of our generation.</p></p><p>This classic horror collection showcases the early career of one of the field's most influential and innovative writers. Much of Richard Matheson's work has found its way into pop culture: the title story became a memorable episode of television's <i>The Twilight Zone</i>, and horror aficionados reading "Prey" will immediately visualize <i>Trilogy of Terror</i>'s Karen Black hunkered down with a butcher knife. But this collection's power lies in its wide-ranging exploration of style and subject and the literary skill that Matheson demonstrated right from the start of his career. Many of his stories were decidedly unconventional when published (most in the 1950s and early 1960s), and still have the power to shock or to satisfy with their graceful inevitability. Matheson is not primarily a monster writer: rather, he examines how we create monsters from our own fears and frailties, and sometimes become the monsters ourselves. <i>Nightmare at 20,000 Feet</i> is a must-have collection for Matheson fans and readers who like their horror spare, precise, and chilling. <i>--Roz Genessee</i><p><b>Richard Matheson</b> is <i>The New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>I Am Legend</i>, <i>Hell House</i>, <i>Other Kingdoms</i>, <i>Somewhere in Time</i>, <i>The Incredible Shrinking Man</i>, <i>A Stir of Echoes</i>, <i>The Beardless Warriors</i>, <i>The Path</i>, <i>Seven Steps to Midnight</i>, <i>Now You See It...</i>, and <i>What Dreams May Come</i>, among others. He was named a Grand Master of Horror by the World Horror Convention, and received the Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement. He has also won the Edgar, the Spur, and the Writer's Guild awards. In 2010, he was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame. In addition to his novels, Matheson wrote screenplays, and he wrote for several Twilight Zone episodes, including "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet," based on his short story. He was born in New Jersey and raised in Brooklyn, and fought in the infantry in World War II. He earned his bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Missouri.

Throughout the Hebrew Scriptures, these two religions battled for the hearts and minds of the people in claiming radically divergent views of who YHWH is and what it looks like to be YHWH&#39;s people. Though Jesus was killed by the upholders of empire, his resurrection was the definitive vindication of the religion of creation. s a consequence, those who follow his path can accept no violence or domination tward people or creation in his name. While many recent scholars have studies the imperial context of the New Testament, this is the first book to trace this theme throughout the entire Bible.</p><p>Wes Howard-Brook teaches at Seattle University. He is the author of several Orbis books, including Unveiling Empire, The Church Before Christianity, Becoming Children of God, and co-editor of The New Testament: Introducing the Way of Discipleship.Howard-Brook undertakes what few dare anymore: an introductory primer for the whole Bible. . . This book invites disciples to connect the dots, in order to recover our ancient, anti-imperial identity, and to embrace a radical faith and practice that are personal and political. --Ched Myers<br><br>A remarkable offering for those who care about the interface of power and faith with all the threats and seductions that go with it . . . . As I read, I felt overwhelmed, both by the mass of data and by the cunning of interpretation. I could not put it down, and expect to continue to be instructed by it. --Walter Brueggemann<br><br>Howard-Brook illuminates how ancient empires exercised control and manipulation of people not simply by political and military means, but also through the religion of empire. Throughout he makes clear that the core message of the God of creation is to call people out of empire, to refuse to cooperate with the forces of destruction and domination today" --Richard Horsley<br><br>Will become a classic for communities that seek first to receive the gracious gift of God s alternative future to Empire. --Jarrod McKenna<br><br>If we who sojourn in America are to be a community that can both name and resist the lure of Empire, we need a story more powerful that the story called America. Wes Howard-Brook knows that the Bible tells such a story. May its story be ours as we're set free from our imperial imaginations to dream with our Creator of a new world here and now. --Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove</p><h2>William Carlos Williams: Selected Poems: (American Poets Project #14)</h2><p>&#x201c;No poetry is more fresh, more immediate, more deftly challenging,&#x201d; writes editor Robert Pinsky. &#x201c;William Carlos Williams is at the center of one of poetry&#x2019;s greatest historical flowerings.&#x201d; A poet of astonishing range and inventiveness, Williams was at once a daring formal innovator, one of the band of modernists who transformed American poetry, and an intimate, sometimes savagely frank chronicler of the life and landscape of his native New Jersey.<br><br>From the beginning he pursued an independent course, creating a diverse and unfailingly vital body of work, from the hard-edged experiments of&nbsp;<i>Spring and All</i>&nbsp;to the fluent lyricism of &#x201c;Asphodel, That Greeny Flower.&#x201d; His influence on generations of poets has been indelible, and as this masterful new selection demonstrates, his poems retain their capacity to astonish and delight.<br><br><b>About the American Poets Project</b><br>Elegantly designed in compact editions, printed on acid-free paper, and textually authoritative, the American Poets Project makes available the full range of the American poetic accomplishment, selected and introduced by today&#x2019;s most discerning poets and critics.</p><p><b>William Carlos Williams</b> (1883-1963) was one of the leading modernist poets of his generation.<br><br><b>Robert Pinsky</b>, editor, is the author of numerous books of poetry and criticism, including&nbsp;<i>The Figured Wheel: New and Collected Poems 1966-1996.</i>&nbsp;His&nbsp;<i>History Of My Heart</i>&nbsp;(1984) received the William Carlos Williams Prize, awarded by the Poetry Society of America.

Fischer provides a much-needed corrective to the literature on spiritual accompaniment with a method that includes a synthesis of scholarship and the stories of women&#39;s lives. She addresses issues of power, anger, and violence against women, as well as women&#39;s spiritual heritage...&#39; Katherine M. Dyckman SNJM, co-author, Inviting the Mystic, Supporting the Prophet and Chaos or Creation: Spirituality in Mid-LifeTherapist, spiritual director, theologian, and teacher, Fischer explores ways that new approaches to direction can heal and empower women, bridging the gap between inchoate experiences and traditional meanings assigned by men. Some topics here are standard (paradigms of growth, images of God, prayer styles), while others deal with women's special concerns (issues of power, anger, and sexist violence), but all are seen through a nonradical feminist lens. Testimonies of Fischer's directees, biblical stories, and reflective prayer exercises enrich this thoughtful work.-- EC<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Thick as Thieves: An Andrea Carter Book (Circle C Milestones, 1)</h2><p><p><strong>Girls will love Andrea's new adventures in Circle C Milestones, the continuation of Susan K.

I know I do. I&#x2019;m an eight-aday &#x201c;cupper.&#x201d; And even at that, I&#x2019;m a wuss in my &#x201c;attachment&#x201d; (a Buddhist usage that I feel works much better than <b><i>addiction</i></b>). At least when my habit is compared to the eighteenth-century composer Johann Sebastian Bach, the eighteenth-century philosopher Voltaire, and especially the nineteenthcentury French novelist Balzac (called by Baudelaire &#x201c;the novelist of energy and will&#x201d;),who drank more than fifty cups of coffee a day. (He died at age fifty, some say from caffeine poisoning.)<br>People around the world drink more coffee than any other drink besides water: four hundred billion cups a year. And more people are drinking more coffee more frequently with every passing year. Second only to oil as a USAmerican import, coffee is the drug of choice for the majority of North Americans, with 167 million USAmerican coffee drinkers alone quaffing five million tons a year in this nineteen-billion-dollar industry.The average coffee drinker admits to 3.4 cups a day. But remember: a &#x201c;small&#x201d; Starbucks cup is &#x201c;tall.&#x201d;<br>Looked at another way, every USAmerican over eighteen years of age swills one and four-fifths cups of coffee a day.But compared to either the Viennese or Swiss, we&#x2019;re teetotalers. Our per capita consumption of more than ten pounds of coffee beans per year looks puny compared to the Austrians<br>(14 pounds) or the Swiss (15.5 pounds). In the Netherlands, each citizen (birth to nursing home) downs on average an amazing four cups a day.<br><b><br>A HEALTHFUL JOLT OF JAVA<br></b>Of course, coffee consumption in USAmerica pales in comparison to soft drinks (70 percent of which are carbonated). Soda pop and other such beverages add up to 574 cans for every man, woman, and child. But unlike soda&#x2019;s sugar high, java jolts are actually good for you. Historically, physicians have been of two minds about caffeine. When they were not warning of its harmful effects, they were prescribing coffee for healthful impact on an astounding variety of diseases&#x2014;from kidney stones and gout to smallpox, measles, and coughs. Now that sophisticated studies are being conducted to find out the real impact of caffeine, it seems the harder researchers work to detect the bad things<br>coffee does to you, the more they unearth coffee&#x2019;s health benefits.<br>It is known, for instance, that coffee delivers more health-giving antioxidants to our diet than fruit, vegetables, and nuts. At six cups a day and under, coffee reduces your chance of getting Parkinson&#x2019;s disease, liver and colon cancer, cirrhosis of the liver, Type 2 diabetes, and, if you are a fast metabolizer, heart disease. As a bonus, coffee improves male fertility. Caffeine can also protect you against skin cancer&#x2014;but you&#x2019;d have to smear it on your body for it to work.<br><b><br>COFFEE AND YOUR SOUL<br></b>Unlike soda, coffee improves creativity, fights fatigue, and has a long half life (six hours). Just ask a college student. Also unlike soda, coffee is a hospitality drink, a sign of welcome and openness to sharing. There are few things I enjoy more in life than what I call soulcaf�s: sharing good stories over good coffee. I&#x2019;ve had my share of bad stories over bad coffee too. But either way, a soulcaf� represents some of the most memorable moments of my life. I&#x2019;ve had soulcaf�s with mysterious brews<br>I call airport coffee over vinyl tablecloths, hospital coffee over waiting-room chairs, cowboy coffee<br>over bare picnic tables, and thermos coffee over workshop benches. My favorite soulcaf� is communion coffee, which fuels passionate brainstorms with other dreamers and schemers. Coffee talk makes the best God talk.<br>It will come as no surprise that my coffee of choice is Starbucks, not just because they brew a superior variety of coffee but because of the experience that comes with the drink. You can enjoy Starbucks alone, but it&#x2019;s preferable to go there with a friend.<br>Starbucks Coffee Company is arguably the number one corporate success story of the last quarter century. Its stock is up 5,775 percent since it went public in 1992. Some call Starbucks &#x201c;Fourbucks&#x201d; because that&#x2019;s what they usually end up spending there. But customers flock to Starbucks not to stand in line so they can pay three or four bucks for a cup of coffee. They pay so they can enjoy the Starbucks experience. The value comes with the experience that surrounds the cup of coffee. Starbucks lovers connect with the warmth of friends as they enjoy the warmth of their favorite drink.<br><b><br>A SENSORY FEAST<br></b>If you&#x2019;re a fan of Starbucks, you know what I&#x2019;m talking about. You walk in and are greeted by rich, opaque colors from every angle. In the background, appealing music thick with atmosphere refrains from masking the almost whistle of the espresso machine. Dim lighting keeps the mood relaxed but suggestive, and a medley of complex coffee smells ooze from every surface you touch. In a number of ways, Starbucks is a three-dollar sensory feast. In this book we will examine the Starbucks experience not simply so we can talk about coffee or the four million coffee drinks that Starbucks sells daily in USAmerica, but so we can learn what Starbucks has come close to perfecting&#x2014;that life is meant to be lived with passion, and that passion is found and practiced through experiences, connection, symbols and images, and the full participation of every part of your being. Not only do these simple truths explain the phenomenal growth of Starbucks Coffee Company, they also point out the blind spots, weaknesses, and failures of the church to serve people at the level of life&#x2019;s bottom line: passion and meaning.<br>Let&#x2019;s be honest: <b><i>life </i></b>is a loaded word. It can mean everything from resignation (&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s life.&#x201d;) to exhilaration (&#x201c;I love life!&#x201d;). The ancient Greek language helps us here. Like the four Greek words for <b><i>love, </i></b>Greek also has many words for <b><i>life. </i></b>In this book, we&#x2019;ll examine what I have coined the EPIC life, which in Greek is the word <b><i>zoe. </i></b>(We&#x2019;re not concerned here with the life of mere existence, <b><i>bios.</i></b>) Zoe means flamboyant, passionate life. Or in the words of Jesus: &#x201c;I have come that they may have <b><i>zoe, </i></b>and have it to the full.&#x201d;<br>Jesus recommended that his disciples learn something from the wisdom of the world. He observed that &#x201c;the people of this world&#x201d; pursue their dreams with greater passion and intelligence than &#x201c;the people of the light.&#x201d; One of my favorite theologians, Augustine of Hippo, made the case for finding bona fide beauty in the world (forged in the light of his own struggle with Manichaeism), all of which underscores the wisdom of keeping our eyes open to the truth that surrounds us.<br><b><br>A DRINK OF PASSION AND A PASSIONATE FAITH<br></b>With almost every study, it seems, we are discovering that fewer USAmericans than was previously thought attend church. Organized religion has been assuming that because it has a better product&#x2014;namely, God&#x2014;that it simply needs to open the doors and customers will line up. That assumption no<br>longer holds. Christians have much to learn about faith as a lived experience, not a thought experiment. Rational faith&#x2014;the form of Christianity that relies on argument, logic, and apologetics to establish and defend its rightness&#x2014;has failed miserably in meeting people where they live. Intellectual arguments over doctrine and theology are fine for divinity school, but they lose impact at the level of daily life experience. Starbucks knows that people live for engagement, connection, symbols, and meaningful experiences. If you read the Bible, you&#x2019;ll see that the people of God throughout history have known the same thing. Life at its very best is a passionate experience, not a doctoral dissertation. The problem is not that Christianity can&#x2019;t be believed, but that it can&#x2019;t be practiced because of its lack of lived experience. And it can&#x2019;t be observed by others because there are too few Christians who are radical enough to manifest what the gospel really looks like. The church has not always been so disconnected from the raw elements of life. And it&#x2019;s entirely possible for people of faith to get back to the elementary,<br>elemental aspects of their faith, their spirituality, and the gospel they proclaim. The question is, How?<br>As a beginning point in answering that question, let&#x2019;s examine a tangible and compelling example: the philosophy and practices of Starbucks Coffee Company. Let me issue an invitation to learn (or in some cases, to relearn) how to meet God in an irresistible experience, how to trade religious duty for spiritual passion, and how to engage in the life of faith in close relationship with other wayfarers. It&#x2019;s time to take seriously the first and last commands of the Bible: eat freely and drink freely. If you can wait until I pour myself a fresh cup of Christmas Blend (my very favorite), we&#x2019;ll begin to do just that.</p><h2>City of Clowns</h2><p><b>A gorgeously rendered graphic novel of Daniel Alarc�n&#x2019;s story&nbsp;<i>City of Clowns</i>. From the author of <i>The King Is Always Above the People</i>,&nbsp;<b>which was longlisted for the 2017 National Book Award for Fiction.</b></b><br><br> Oscar &#x201c;Chino&#x201d; Uribe is a young Peruvian journalist for a local tabloid paper. After the recent death of his philandering father, he must confront the idea of his father&#x2019;s other family, and how much of his own identity has been shaped by his father&#x2019;s murky morals. At the same time, he begins to chronicle the life of street clowns, sad characters who populate the violent and corrupt city streets of Lima, and is drawn into their haunting, fantastical world.<br><br> This remarkably affecting story by Daniel Alarc�n was included in his acclaimed first book, <i>War by Candlelight</i>, and now, in collaboration with artist Sheila Alvarado, it takes on a new, thrilling form. This graphic novel, with its short punches of action and images, its stark contrasts between light and dark, truth and fiction, perfectly corresponds to the tone of Chino&#x2019;s story. With the city of Lima as a character, and the bold visual language from the story, <i>City of Clowns</i> is moving, menacing, and brilliantly vivid.</p><p><p><b>Daniel Alarc�n&nbsp;</b>is the author of the National Book Award finalist story collection <i>The King Is Always Above the People</i>, the novel&nbsp;<i>At Night We Walk in Circles</i>, which was a finalist for the 2014 PEN-Faulkner Award, as well as the story collection&nbsp;<i>War by Candlelight</i>&nbsp;and the novel&nbsp;<i>Lost City Radio</i>. His writing has appeared in the&nbsp;<i>New York Times Magazine</i>,&nbsp;<i>Granta</i>,&nbsp;<i>n+1</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Harpers</i>, and in 2010, he was named one of the&nbsp;<i>New Yorker</i>'s "20 under 40." He is Executive Producer of&nbsp;<i>Radio Ambulante</i>, and teaches at the Columbia University School of Journalism in New York.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><b> Sheila Alvarado</b>&nbsp;is an artist, illustrator, and author. She lives in Lima, Peru.</p><b>Praise for <i>City of Clowns</i></b><br><br>"The tale takes on a breathtaking new dimension... Dynamic... [A]&nbsp;haunted atmosphere permeates every page. Alvarado renders Alarc�n's source material in stark black and white, a scratchy yet refined style that's full of deep shadows and woodcut-like crosshatching. But it's her composition that truly brings&nbsp;<i>City of Clowns</i>&nbsp;to life. Rather than relying on a typical comic-book grid, Alvarado employs an inventive architecture of panels; some float in fields of negative space, while others are framed as bricks in a wall or sheets drying on a line. At certain points, she abandons panels altogether in favor of a more flowing, expressionist layout. Even her most daring experiments in form, though, succeed in thoughtfully conveying the pensive tone and subtext of Alarc�n's meditation on guilt, regret, and forgiveness &#x2014; and sometimes the gut-punching lack thereof."&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;<i>NPR<br><br></i>&#x201c;Sheila Alvarado lends visual brilliance to Alarcon&#x2019;s affecting tale.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i><br><br>"Fantastical."<br>&#x2014;<i>Vanity Fair</i><br><br>&#x201c;The story of Chino and his father is told in equal parts narration and flashback, with simple, black and white illustrations by Sheila Alvarado that complement Alarc�n's understated yet poignant prose . . . Alarc�n writes in simple, conversational language that makes for an easy read while also evoking a sense of intimacy, that quality more often associated with memoirs than fiction. It's that very directness that Alarc�n employs to great effect; reading <i>City of Clowns</i> I had the sense that I was being made privy to a story at once profoundly personal and also universal.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2014;Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>&#x201c;This graphic-novel adaptation strips the original short story to its essential elements but loses none of the rawness or tension. In stark black and white, Alvarado&#x2019;s illustrations intensify the sentiment of the text through visual interpretations ranging from literal to purely fantastical. Frequently stunning in their clarity and economy, the illustrations give this already complex story an added layer of richness and depth. Darkly satisfying but with no easy endings.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><b>Praise for </b><i><b>At Night We Walk in Circles </b></i><br><br> &#x201c;Wise and engaging . . .

This book, which is now in its third large printing, contains the most important and complete account of Indian jewelry fashioned by the Navajo, the Zuni, the Hopi, and other Pueblo peoples. "With the care of a meticulous and thorough scholar, the author has told the story of his several years' investigation of jewelry making among the Southwestern Indians," says <em>The Dallas Times Herald</em>. "So richly decorative are the plates he uses ... that the conscientious narrative is surrounded by an atmosphere of genuinely exciting visual experience." John Adair is a trained ethnologist who has lived and worked among these Indians.</p> <p>To prepare his book, Mr. Adair made an exhaustive examination of the principal museum collections of Navajo and Pueblo silver work, both early and modem, in Santa Fe, Colorado Springs, Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia. He visited trading posts in the Indian country and examined and photographed silver on the pawn racks and in important private collections. He lived for a time among the Navajo, watched them make their jewelry, and actually learned to work silver himself in the hogan of one of the leading artisans, Tom Burnsides. Many of the photographs he made at the time are used as illustrations in this book. He spent months among the Indians in New Mexico and Arizona and became personally acquainted with many of their silversmiths. Later, as field worker for the Indian Arts and Crafts Board, he studied the economics of Navajo and Pueblo silversmithing; and still later he became manager of the Navajo Arts and Crafts Guild, a tribal enterprise.</p> <p><em>The Navajo and Pueblo Silversmiths</em> provides a full history of the craft and the actual names and localities of the pioneer craftsmen who introduced the art of the silversmith to their people. Despite its present high stage of development, with its many subtle and often exquisite designs, the art of working silver is not an ancient one among the Navajo and Pueblo Indians. There are men still living today who remember the very first silversmiths.</p> <p>Mr. Adair gives full details, as he observed them, of the methods and techniques of manufacture over a primitive forge with homemade tools. He tells both of the fine pieces made for trade among the Indians themselves and of the newer, cheaper types of jewelry produced for sale to tourists. He discusses standards and qualities of Indian silver and describes the work of the Indian schools in helping preserve traditional design in the fine silver of today. His excellent photographs of some of the most notable pieces, old and new, provide examples for evaluation. This volume, therefore, will serve the layman, the ethnologist, and the dealer alike as a guide to proper values in Indian silver jewelry, and will provide the basis for authoritative knowledge and appreciation of a highly skilled creative art.<br><br></p></p><p><p><strong>John Adair</strong>, (1913-1997) was a founder of the Navajo Arts and Crafts Guild and the chief anthropologist on the staff of the Cornell Navajo Field Health Project.</p> <p>Adair received a bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1937 and a doctorate from the University of New Mexico, where he studied from 1946 to 1948.

A little overloaded, perhaps&#x2014;the oddly assorted cargo includes piles of old newspapers and heaps of tobacco&#x2014;the ship departs for the Panama Canal from Norfolk, Virginia, on a beautiful autumn day. Before long, the weather turns unexpectedly rough&#x2014;rougher in fact than even the most experienced members of the crew have ever encountered. The <i>Archimedes, </i>it turns out, has been swept up in the vortex of an immense hurricane, and for the next four days it will be battered and mauled by wind and waves as it is driven wildly off course. Caught in an unremitting struggle for survival, both the crew and the ship will be tested as never before.<br><br>Based on detailed research into an actual event, Richard Hughes&#x2019;s tale of high suspense on the high seas is an extraordinary story of men under pressure and the unexpected ways they prove their mettle&#x2014;or crack. Yet the originality, art, and greatness of <i>In Hazard</i> stem from something else: Hughes&#x2019;s eerie fascination with the hurricane itself, the inhuman force around which this wrenching tale of humanity at its limits revolves. Hughes channels the furies of sea and sky into a piece of writing that is both apocalyptic and analytic. <i>In Hazard</i> is an unforgettable, defining work of modern adventure.</p><p><b>Richard Hughes </b>(1900&#x2014;1976) attended Oxford and lived for most of his life in a castle in Wales. His books include <i>The Fox in the Attic, The Wooden Shepherdess</i>, and <i>A High Wind in Jamaica.</i> He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and, in the United States, an honorary member of both the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1946.<br><br><b>John Crowley</b> is the author of many critically acclaimed books, including <i>Love &amp; Sleep, Aegypt</i>, and <i>Little, Big</i>. He lives in northern Massachusetts with his wife and twin daughters." With his eerie narrator (Is it a surviving crew member? The author? Poseidon himself?), Hughes presents an atmospheric book that makes trouble with pirates, rocky shoals or white whales seem almost trifling." --<i>Time Out New York</i><br><br>"The passages in literature that have thrilled me most have almost all been sea battles and storms. Now I have had the great and exhilarating pleasure of surviving yet another tempest in Richard Hughes's <i>In Hazard</i>, now equipped with an excellent introduction by John Crowley... The novel is superb." --Katharine Powers, <i>The Boston Globe</i><br><br>"To take the same subject as Conrad in <i>Typhoon </i>would be foolhardy if it were not so triumphantly justified." -Graham Greene <br><br>"Richard Hughes is a genuine case of unfair neglect, and will some day be seen again as one of the very best novelist of the past hundred years from Great Britain...<i>In Hazard </i>is much more than a brilliant sea story. The tale is about extreme danger and human reactions to it...It seems just as apposite to our times, when we confront a bewildering range of hazards, including the destructiveness of nature, which we ourselves are probably exacerbating." -<i>The Financial Times</i><br><br>"Richard Hughes...has done another magnificent saga of the sea in this novel which inevitably calls to mind Conrad's <i>Typhoon, </i>not for similarity in the progression of the novel, but because of the power with which the author evokes the man's struggle against the elements. A story of mad weather at sea, it is told with restraint, humor and irony. Almost compulsory reading." -<i>North American Fiction Review</i><br><br>"<i>In Hazard </i>is not really a book about a storm, but about fear...what will stick in most minds are the sharp descriptive passages--of a scene, illuminated by lightning, when the crew looks out on a mountainside of water crawling with sharks." &#x2014;<i>Time</i><br><br>"The most intense reading experience of the year-easily-was discovering Richard Hughes's 1938 novel, <i>In Hazard</i>, a small masterpiece of lyric terror about a cargo ship that runs into a hurricane, but also about the rest of life. It might have helped that I read it in a force 10 gale on the Atlantic but reading it in the bath would probably have the same impact."-Simon Schama, <i>The Guardian</i><br><br>"Every bit the equal of <i>Perfect Storm</i>, this is the story of a freighter that gets caught out in the worst hurricane ever recorded at the time. It's terrifying, and it's also wonderfully written." -Boat Safe</p><h2>The Lurking Fear: Collected Short Stories Volume Four (Tales of Mystery &amp; the Supernatural)</h2><p>&#39;The thing came abruptly and unannounced; a demon, rat-like, scurrying from pits remote and unimaginable, a hellish panting and stifled grunting, and then from that opening beneath the chimney a burst of multitudinous and leprous life - a loathsome night-spawned flood of organic corruption more devastatingly hideous than the blackest conjurations of mortal madness and morbidity.&#39; Only the expansive imagination of H.P. Lovecraft could conceive the delicious and spine-tingling horrors you will find within the pages of this unique collection. In addition to such classics as The Picture in the House, The Music of Erich Zann and The Rats in the Walls, this volume contains some fascinating rarities: examples of Lovecraft&#39;s earliest weird fiction and material unpublished during his lifetime. H.P. Lovecraft&#39;s creation of the Cthulhu Mythos has influenced many modern authors, and still remains at the forefront of supernatural literature.</p><p></p><h2>The Last Girl: My Story of Captivity and My Fight Against the Islamic State</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

She lives in Southern California.<p></p><p>Acknowledgments</p><p></p><p></p><p>You know that saying about being careful what you wish for? My name is Molly Pink, and I can tell you it&#x2019;s one hundred percent true. Ever since my husband, Charlie, died, I&#x2019;ve been saying that I want to try flying solo. To live without having to answer to anyone. You know, I could wear sweatpants with a hole in them and eat ice cream for dinner. I&#x2019;d be the captain of my own ship.</p><p>I thought I was headed right to that lifestyle. I&#x2019;d gotten past my grief and had started a new chapter in my life by getting the job at Shedd &amp; Royal Books and More as the event coordinator/community relations person. But then I met Barry Greenberg and we had a relationship. Okay, maybe he was my boyfriend. It&#x2019;s hard for me to say that word, even in my mind. It just sounds so ridiculous since Barry is a homicide detective in his fifties.</p><p>You might notice I said <i>had</i> a relationship. Really it was off and on again and off again and on again. You get the picture. But now it was finally off forever.</p><p>Let me offer a little catch-up on that. During all the off and on again of our relationship, there had been the complication of my friendship with Mason Fields. Mason had always wanted it to be something more, but I had wanted it to stay the same.</p><p>Then, when Barry and I had yet another hiccup, we decided we would be better off as friends. Barry had seemed to accept it, but then he showed up and said he was walking away from the whole situation. He said the friendship thing was all a sham and I was the only one who didn&#x2019;t know it. Then he suggested I go out with Mason because I deserved better than what he, Barry, could offer.</p><p>It reminded me of the whole King Solomon story when two women were fighting over a baby and the king offered to cut it in half. One of the women stepped forward, relinquishing her claim rather than seeing the baby injured. The king knew that meant she loved the baby more and gave it to her. So, it seemed Barry was saying he cared more because he was so concerned with my happiness. But that didn&#x2019;t mean I was ready to resume our relationship.</p><p>I had never told Mason about Barry&#x2019;s gallant act. Actually, I had barely talked to Mason after that. It was all on my part and I&#x2019;m not even sure why. He left messages and I didn&#x2019;t return them. Then the holidays hit and I got lost in work. Mason stopped trying to contact me. I can only imagine what he thought. In the end, I had let my social life go dark.</p><p>Assorted people had been staying with me for various reasons, but that had all ended as well.</p><p>The final step came when my son Samuel moved out&#x2014;well, in&#x2014;with his girlfriend. Though he didn&#x2019;t take his cats.</p><p>And suddenly there I was alone. At least almost alone. I had the two cats and two dogs: my terrier mix, Blondie, and Cosmo, a little black dog that was supposed to be Barry and his son&#x2019;s dog, but that&#x2019;s another story. So here at last was my chance to soar on my own wings. Do whatever I wanted. Answer to no one.</p><p>At first I was so busy with the holidays and everything at the bookstore, I didn&#x2019;t think much about being on my own. But it was January now, and as I once again looked around my cavernous living room, it all began to get to me. I made a tour of the three bedrooms on the other side of the house from mine. Only the one I used to keep all my yarn and crochet stuff in showed any signs of life. The other two were uncomfortably neat. My footsteps echoed as I walked into the kitchen. It was just as I&#x2019;d left it when I went to bed. Just like yesterday and a lot of yesterdays before, there were no dishes in the sink, no ravaged refrigerator. No one had come knocking at my door in the middle of the night looking for comfort after a bad night with suspects. No one had called and suggested a fun outing. All the peace started to overwhelm me.</p><p>I made coffee for myself quickly. Did I want to sit around and revel in all this quiet and independence? No. I couldn&#x2019;t wait to get to work and the problems, the confusion, and most of all the people. I&#x2019;d heard the statement that silence is deafening, and now I understood it. I needed some noise. I needed some upheaval in my life. Yes, I had learned my lesson about being careful what I wished for. I&#x2019;d gotten it in spades and absolutely hated it. I knew what I had to do to stir up the pot of my life.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t even drink the coffee in my kitchen. I filled a commuter cup and made sure the dry cat food bowl was full and located where the dogs couldn&#x2019;t help themselves. And I left.</p><p>It took a bit of doing to zip up my jacket while holding the coffee mug as I crossed the backyard. Even here in Southern California, January days are short and chilly. I probably seemed like a wimp for bringing it up when it was icy and snowy back east, but the dew had frozen on the grass.</p><p>The sun had already melted the thin layer of frost on the greenmobile, as I called my vintage blue green Mercedes. <i>Vintage</i> sounded so much better than <i>old</i>. I ran the windshield wipers for a moment, and they got rid of the residue of moisture. One negative about my car: no cup holder, which meant I had to hold the commuter mug between my legs. I looked down at my usual khaki slacks and hoped I&#x2019;d make it to work without any coffee stains.</p><p>A few minutes later, I pulled the car into the parking lot behind Shedd &amp; Royal Books and More. Once I was inside, I inhaled deeply, noting the familiar fragrance of the paper in thousands of books, mixed with freshly brewed coffee coming in from the caf�, and nodded a greeting at Rayaad, our chief cashier.</p><p>The last of the holiday merchandise was gathered on a front table with a sale sign. Even after all these years it still seemed odd how the same merchandise looked so exciting before the holiday and irrelevant after. I mean, a chocolate Santa was still, at the heart, chocolate.</p><p>Any day we&#x2019;d start putting up Valentine&#x2019;s Day decorations and sell the same type of chocolate the Santa was made out of shaped like hearts wrapped in red foil.</p><p>As I made my way through the store, I saw the playwrights&#x2019; group gathered in a tight circle around their facilitator. The yarn department was in the back corner of the store, and along with handling events and community relations, it was my baby. I always liked walking in and seeing the feast of color from the cubbies of yarn. Ever since we&#x2019;d put up a permanent worktable in the middle of the area, it was never empty.</p><p>I recognized a few faces of my fellow Hookers. That&#x2019;s hookers as in crochet. The Tarzana Hookers had been meeting at the bookstore since even before the yarn department had been added.</p><p>We exchanged a flurry of greetings just as Dinah Lyons caught up with me. She&#x2019;s my best friend, a fellow Hooker and an English instructor at the local community college. She slipped off her loden green boiled wool jacket and dropped it on a chair.</p><p>&#x201c;I need to talk to you,&#x201d; I said as we hugged each other. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve decided to change my life.&#x201d; Dinah&#x2019;s eyes snapped to attention as she got ready to listen. Then my voice dropped. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll have to wait.&#x201d; Mrs. Shedd had just joined us. She was the &#x201c;Shedd&#x201d; in Shedd &amp; Royal and my boss. This wasn&#x2019;t a usual gathering of the crochet group to work on projects. This was a meeting.</p><p>&#x201c;Give me an update,&#x201d; Mrs. Shedd said quickly. She never seemed to change. Her blond hair didn&#x2019;t have a hint of gray even though she was well into her sixties. She&#x2019;d been wearing a soft pageboy style for so long, I bet her hair naturally fell into place when she washed it.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t sit and seemed a little nervous, but that seemed to be her default emotion lately. Keeping a bookstore afloat these days wasn&#x2019;t easy. We were surviving, but only by broadening our horizons. Thanks to my efforts, the bookstore had become almost a community center. Besides the playwright group, I&#x2019;d added other writing and book groups. We&#x2019;d recently taken on hosting crochet-themed parties, which was turning into a nice success. And, of course, we had author events.</p><p>But what we were attempting this time was really a stretch and required an outlay of cash. &#x201c;Tell me again why we&#x2019;re doing this,&#x201d; my boss said, looking for reassurance.</p><p>Adele Abrams joined us as Mrs. Shedd was speaking. Adele was still dressed in her outfit from story time. Just guessing, but I bet she&#x2019;d read <i>Good Morning, June</i>. It was a children&#x2019;s classic written in a different time when girls wore pinafores like the pink one Adele wore over a puffy-sleeved dress. She&#x2019;d completed the look by forcing her brown hair into tiny little braids. Adele would have stood out even without the outfit. She was tallish and amply built, and her voice naturally went toward loud.</p><p>Before I could say anything, Adele began. &#x201c;This is the chance of a lifetime. We are carrying the torch of crochet into the world of knitters.&#x201d; Mrs. Shedd didn&#x2019;t look impressed. Who could blame her? She wasn&#x2019;t interested in us being pioneers as much as doing something that would make a profit and help the bookstore. I was relieved when CeeCee Collins slipped into the chair at the head of the table and took the floor away from Adele.</p><p>&#x201c;I feel responsible for encouraging you to have the booth at the yarn show. I&#x2019;m sure it&#x2019;s going to be a big success,&#x201d; CeeCee said to my boss.</p><p>CeeCee was the real head of our crochet group, though Adele never quite accepted it. She was also a well-known actress who, after a long history of TV and film appearances, had started a whole new chapter in her career when she began hosting a reality show. Then she nabbed the part of Ophelia in the movie based on the super-hit series of books about a vampire who crocheted. We&#x2019;d been hearing there was Oscar buzz about her performance since the movie had come out, but rumor is different from fact, and the actual Oscar nominations were going to be announced in the next couple of weeks. Needless to say, CeeCee was a little edgy.</p><p>As always, CeeCee was dressed to be photographed. She said she&#x2019;d seen enough celebrities snapped in jeans and T-shirts with their hair sticking up to learn her lesson. But, she claimed it was a fine art, not to look too done. Kind of like her reality show. It was supposed to look real, but a lot of editing and planning went into what the audience ended up seeing.</p><p>CeeCee noticed the two women at the other end of the table who were not part of the group. They appeared to have no idea what was going on. CeeCee, in her typical gracious manner, explained that we were talking about the bookstore&#x2019;s upcoming booth at the Southern California Knit Style Show.</p><p>&#x201c;This is a very big deal because it&#x2019;s the first year they&#x2019;re including crochet in the show. Before, everything was just about knitting. You know, knitting classes, fashion shows of knitted garments, design competitions for knitted pieces. There probably wasn&#x2019;t even a lonely crochet hook for sale in any of the vendors&#x2019; booths in the marketplace.&#x201d;</p><p>CeeCee made a slight bow with her head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to think I had something to do with K.D.&#x2019;s change of heart.&#x201d; She explained to the women that K.D. Kirby put on the show along with being the publisher of a number of knitting magazines. &#x201c;I was the only crocheter included in an article in <i>Knit Style</i> magazine about celebrity yarn crafters. I think hearing about how popular the craft is and seeing what wonderful things you can make made her realize what a mistake it was not to bring crochet into the show.&#x201d;</p><p>The women nodded their heads in unison to show they were listening, though I noticed knitting needles sticking out of their tote bags. &#x201c;So, this year there is going to be a crochet category in the design competition with yours truly as the judge.&#x201d; CeeCee did another little nodding bow before adding that she was also going to be acting as the celebrity face of the show.</p><p>One of the women finally spoke. &#x201c;So you mean you can do more with crochet than just make edging on something or use up scraps of yarn to make one of those afghans full of squares?&#x201d;</p><p>Adele was squirming in her seat at their words. All of the Hookers thought that crochet was the more interesting yarn craft, but Adele took it even further. She thought crochet was superior to knitting, and she wasn&#x2019;t afraid to say it.</p><p>CeeCee put her hand on Adele&#x2019;s shoulder. It looked like it was just for reassurance, but I knew it was to hold her in her seat. &#x201c;Why yes, crochet has become quite a fashion statement. Designers have taken intricate lace patterns that had been used to make doilies and are blowing them out into shrugs.&#x201d; CeeCee had taken her hand off Adele&#x2019;s shoulder, and my bookstore coworker took the opportunity to pop out of her chair and start talking.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to be teaching one of the crochet classes,&#x201d; Adele said, doing an imitation of CeeCee&#x2019;s bow. &#x201c;A stash buster wrap.&#x201d; The women didn&#x2019;t seem to know what to make of Adele&#x2019;s statement and looked back to CeeCee for some kind of reassurance.</p><p>CeeCee dropped her voice and spoke directly to Adele. &#x201c;We need to talk about that.&#x201d;</p><p>Since the booth was sort of my baby, I jumped in and told Mrs. Shedd how we&#x2019;d come up with a plan to bring shoppers to our booth. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to teach people how to make a little granny square pin with some beads for decoration.&#x201d; I was glad I had brought a sample and showed it to my boss and the women.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s wonderful,&#x201d; one of them said. &#x201c;I bet a lot of people will want to make one of those.&#x201d;</p><p>It was like music to Mrs. Shedd&#x2019;s ears, and she looked a little less tense. &#x201c;Bob wants to have us offer some of his treats,&#x201d; I added. Bob was the barista at the bookstore caf�. He also made fresh baked goods. &#x201c;The wonderful smell alone would act like a magnet.&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Royal arrived carrying a piece of poster board with a miniature version of the booth he&#x2019;d constructed. He laid it on the table in front of us all, as more of our group arrived. We all leaned over and admired it. The two newcomers got up and walked to the head of the table to get a better view.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s wonderful,&#x201d; I said. It looked like a little store. There was even a sign across the front announcing the name of the bookstore in big letters. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s just one thing missing,&#x201d; Adele said as she scribbled something on a piece of paper and tore off a strip. She attached it to the bookstore sign. It said: &#x201c;Crochet Spoken Here.&#x201d;</p><p>Mrs. Shedd seemed a little less worried when she saw the name of the bookstore prominently displayed. &#x201c;A lot of the people coming to this show are local. We want to make them aware of us. Perhaps you can add something that mentions all the groups we have meeting here.&#x201d;</p><p>I reassured Mrs. Shedd that with the Hookers helping we&#x2019;d make sure the bookstore was well presented.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m depending on you two,&#x201d; Mrs. Shedd said, referring to me and Adele, but looking squarely at me. We were the bookstore employees, and no matter what help the others offered, the buck stopped with us, or actually, me.</p><p>I&#x2019;d been hired as the event coordinator and community relations person, and Adele had been given the kids&#x2019; department as sort of a consolation prize, since she thought my job should have been hers. But somehow with one thing and another we&#x2019;d ended up working as a team, putting on the crochet parties and now this booth. Adele balked at being left out of running the yarn depart...</p></p><h2>Lotte in Weimar: The Beloved Returns</h2><p>Thomas Mann, fascinated with the concept of genius and with the richness of German culture, found in Johann Wolfgang von Goethe the embodiment of the German culture hero. Mann's novelistic biography of Goethe was first published in English in 1940. <i>Lotte in Weimar</i> is a vivid dual portrait&#x2014;a complex study of Goethe and of Lotte, the still-vivacious woman who in her youth was the model for Charlotte in Goethe's widely-read <i>The Sorrows of Young Werther</i>. Lotte's thoughts, as she anticipates meeting Goethe again after forty years, and her conversations with those in Weimar who knew the great man, allow Mann to assess Goethe's genius from many points of view. Hayden White's fresh appraisal of the novel reveals its consonances with our own concerns.</p><p><b>Hayden White</b> is Professor of History of Consciousness, University of California, Santa Cruz and author of <i>The Content of Form: Narrative Discourse and Historical Representation, Tropics of Discourse: Essays in Cultural Criticism</i>, and <i>Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe</i>. <b>Thomas Mann</b> (1875-1955), winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1929, wrote essays as well as some of the great fiction of the twentieth century, including <i>Buddenbrooks, The Magic Mountain, Death in Venice, Joseph and His Brothers,</i> and <i>Doctor Faustus</i>.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Circles on the Water</h2><p>More than 150 poems from her seven books of poetry written between 1963 and 1982.</p><p>Marge Piercy is the author of fifteen collections of poetry, including <i>The Art of Blessing the Day; Early Grrrl; Mars and Her Children, My Mother&#x2019;s Body; Available Light; Stone, Paper, Knife; The Moon Is Always Female;</i> and her selected poems, <i>Circles on the Water.</i> Her book of craft essays, <i>Parti-Colored Blocks for a Quilt,</i> is part of the Poets on Poetry series of the University of Michigan Press, and she edited a poetry anthology, <i>Early Ripening.</i> In 1990 her poetry won the Golden Rose, the oldest poetry award in the country.

She was the mother of nine and grandmother of forty-two and the matriarch of royal Europe through her children&#x2019;s marriages. To many, Queen Victoria is a ruler shrouded in myth and mystique, an aging, stiff widow paraded as the figurehead to an all-male imperial enterprise. But in truth, Britain&#x2019;s longest-reigning monarch was one of the most passionate, expressive, humorous, and unconventional women who ever lived, and the story of her life continues to fascinate.<br><br>A. N. Wilson&#x2019;s exhaustively researched and definitive biography includes a wealth of new material from previously unseen sources to show us Queen Victoria as she&#x2019;s never been seen before. Wilson explores the curious set of circumstances that led to Victoria&#x2019;s coronation, her strange and isolated childhood, her passionate marriage to Prince Albert and his pivotal influence even after death, and her widowhood and subsequent intimate friendship with her Highland servant John Brown, all set against the backdrop of this momentous epoch in Britain&#x2019;s history&#x2014;and the world&#x2019;s.<br><br>Born at the very moment of the expansion of British political and commercial power across the globe, Victoria went on to chart a unique course for her country even as she became the matriarch of nearly every great dynasty of Europe. Her destiny was thus interwoven with those of millions of people&#x2014;not just in Europe but in the ever-expanding empire that Britain was becoming throughout the nineteenth century. The famed queen had a face that adorned postage stamps, banners, statues, and busts all over the known world.<br><br>Wilson&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Victoria</i>&nbsp;is a towering achievement, a masterpiece of biography by a writer at the height of his powers.<br><br>*Read the book, then watch the PBS series "Victoria," starring Jenna Coleman (Dr. Who), Rufus Sewell (Pillars of the Earth), Dame Diana Rigg (Game of Thrones),&nbsp;and Tom Hughes (About Time).*</p><p>A.N. Wilson does for the Victorians what Peter Ackroyd did for London. <br>People, not abstract ideas, make history, and nowhere is this more revealed than in this superb portrait of the Victorians in which hundreds of different lives have been pieced together to tell a story. In an entertaining and often dramatic narrative, A.N. Wilson shows us remarkable people in the very act of creating the Victorian age. <br>The industrial-capitalist world came into being because of actual businessmen, journalists and politicians. We meet them in the pages of this fascinating book. Their ideas were challenged by the ideas of other people, such as Karl Marx, William Morris and George Bernard Shaw. Here are the lofty and the famous -- Prince Albert, Lord Palmerston, Charles Dickens, Gladstone and Disraeli -- and here too are the poor and the obscure -- doctors ministering to cholera victims in the big cities, young women working as models for the famous painters, the man who got the British hooked on cigarettes, the butchers and victims of conflict in Ireland, India and Africa. In this authoritative, accessible and insightful book, A.N. Wilson tells a great story -- one that is still unfinished in our own day. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p><b>A.&nbsp;N.

If her Ohio novels are more melancholy and compassionate, her Manhattan novels, exuberant and incisive, sparkle with a cast of writers, show people, businessmen, and hustling hangers-on. All show rich characterization and a flair for the gist of complex social situations. A playful satirist, an unsentimental observer of failed hopes and misguided longings, Dawn Powell is a literary rediscovery of rare importance. In this, one of two volumes collecting nine novels, The Library of America presents the best of Powell&#x2019;s fiction.<br><br><i>Dance Night&nbsp;</i>(1930), Powell&#x2019;s own favorite among her works, is a surprisingly frank treatment of obsessive longing set in an Ohio factory town during the 1920s.&nbsp;<i>Come Back to Sorrento</i>&nbsp;(1932; originally published as&nbsp;<i>The Tenth Moon</i>), a compelling study of frustrated aspirations, tells the story of a woman whose friendship with a music teacher awakens her sense of her life&#x2019;s wasted potential.<br><br>With&nbsp;<i>Turn, Magic, Wheel</i>&nbsp;(1936), a whirlwind tour of Manhattan&#x2019;s literary world, Powell reinvented herself as a satirical writer. Her treatment of the &#x201c;city of perpetual distraction&#x201d; captures the allure of Manhattan with a lightness and wit to be found in all her New York novels.&nbsp;<i>Angels on Toast</i>&nbsp;(1940), whose farcical pace recalls screwball comedy, is a shrewd portrait of the adulterous misadventures of two salesmen. In&nbsp;<i>A Time To Be Born</i>&nbsp;(1942), set during the months before America&#x2019;s entry into World War II, Powell portrays the monstrously egotistical Amanda Keeler Evans&#x2014;one of her most wickedly barbed creations.<br><br><b>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b>&nbsp;is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

Yet for decades after her death, Powell's work was out of print, cherished by a small band of admirers. Only recently has there been a rediscovery of the writer Gore Vidal calls "our best comic novelist," and whom Edmund Wilson considered to be "on a level with Anthony Powell, Evelyn Waugh, and Muriel Spark." With these two volumes, The Library of America presents the best of Powell's quirky, often hilarious, sometimes deeply moving fiction. <p>Dawn Powell&#x2014;-a vital part of literary Greenwich Village from the 1920s through the 1960s&#x2014;-was the tirelessly observant chronicler of two very different worlds: the small-town Ohio where she grew up and the sophisticated Manhattan to which she gravitated.

A screenplay for the mind, a performance on the page, a work of poetry, a mad mix of genres and styles, a novel in the tradition of William S. Burroughs and Ishmael Reed that is like no other novel, <i>Negrophobia</i> begins with the blonde bombshell Bubbles Brazil succumbing to a voodoo spell and entering the inner darkness of her own shiny being. Here crackheads parade in the guise of Muppets, Muslims beat conga drums, Negroes have numbers for names, and H. Rap Remus demands the total and instantaneous extermination of the white race through spontaneous combustion. By the end of it all, after going on a weird trip for the ages, Bubbles herself is strangely transformed.</p><p><b>Darius James</b> (b. 1954) is a writer and spoken-word performance artist.

It neither blinks nor recoils at the stereotypes, insults, and presumptions that have been used to cage and subdue African American self-esteem, but compels its readers to confront rather than retreat from or smooth over the retro Jim Crow imagery....American literature has seen the ascent of talented young black writers who aren&#x2019;t willing to settle for parochial or hidebound conceptions of who they are and what they should say...and it&#x2019;s a fine time to be reminded that crazy, willful acts of hoodoo storytelling such as&nbsp;<i>Negrophobia&nbsp;</i>helped make this renaissance possible." &#x2014;Gene Seymour, <i>Bookforum</i><br>&#x201c;Luridly funny and unsparingly smart, <i>Negrophobia</i> is American arcana of the highest order. And like all truly cool books, destined to forever be ahead of its time.&#x201d; &#x2014;Paul Beatty <br><br>&#x201c;Darius James is a great writer.&#x201d; &#x2014;Kathy Acker <br><br>&#x201c;I opened James&#x2019;s book only to topple into hell.

It was one of those good but rare occasions when I thought there might be one other person in the world that would get what I was doing.&#x201d; &#x2014;Kara Walker, <i>DB Artmag</i> <br><br>"Comic, manic, and amazing, [<i>Negrophobia</i>] tells more about American race relations than all of the walking dead suburban experts, academics, and think tank whores who tell their fellow suburbanites about how it feels to be black." &#x2014;Ishmael Reed <br><br>"Jarring, outrageous images hurtle from nearly every page of this postmodern vivisection of the contemporary African American condition.... There is imagination and wicked humor in all of this, as well as some piercing insight." &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> <br><br>"This is a novel of exposure, not solution. Those willing to take the ride will find language and imagery that provide an understanding of everything offensive and American. To see Bubbles dragged through the mire of racial and sexual taboos is to experience the reclamation of the icons and stereotypes that are the signposts of relations among Americans. It&#x2019;s not an altogether pleasant experience. No one who reads <i>Negrophobia</i> is playing in the dark -- just lost in it. The novel, however, is no more unpleasant an experience than, say, having a police baton swung at your body, or having a steel-tipped boot kick you a few hundred times after you&#x2019;ve been dragged out of your tractor-trailer. With its feet firmly planted in the satiric tradition of Voltaire Ishmael Reed, John Kennedy Toole, and Okot p&#x2019;Bitek, James&#x2019;s book is both timely and necessary." &#x2014;Christian Haye, <i>The Village Voice</i> <br><br>"Wild, non-stop phantasmagoria...In style, theme, and tone, the work of performance artist James is somewhat reminiscent of Ishmael Reed or Amiri Baraka, but his dialog is snappier. The vibrant prose makes for lively reading. Highly recommended." &#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i> <br><br><i>&nbsp;</i>"A pop-schlock phantasmagoria that owes as much to William Burroughs as it does to S. Clay Wilson. James&#x2019;s raucous debut is by far the best novel to emerge from New York&#x2019;s Lower East Side literary scene." &#x2014;<i>Kirkus</i> <br> "Darius James is one of the funniest writers in America, and one of the most serious. His subject is the big one: slavery; his questions are the big ones: who is slave to what?" &#x2014;George Trow<br>"Comic strip, sci-fi flick, vaudeville, black-faced minstrel show, and lyrical poem all rolled into one. <i>Negrophobia</i> is a funky, raunchy, angry, hilarious nightmare vision of black culture. A ferocious send-up of African-American stereotypes and white racism. Darius James bursts into literature with a wild, surrealistic imagination." &#x2014;Catherine Texier <br><br>"Darius James is a dazzling scenarist, a wanton imagist and a nubile perpetrator of the great felony on new literature. This is a writer of blazing intensity. Forever may he wave." &#x2014;Joel Rose <br><br>"This book is not a novel but a curse which will explode in your mind and cause your bottom to drop out.

She was the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of numerous novels, including <i>Sullivan's Island</i>, <i>Plantation</i>, <i>Pawleys Island</i>, <i>Shem Creek</i>, and <i>Isle of Palms</i>.Dorothea Benton Frank doesn't do justice to her own prose. She reads her Southern story of marital strife, which is filled with drama and conflict, without much drama in her performance. While she has an interesting husky voice, she reads woodenly. The many characters are all read with the same affect. Children, women, and men are all voiced in the same tone and tempo. Descriptions of the coast go by too quickly to savor Benton Frank's evocative writing, so this novel may be more enjoyable in the print version.

The instrument of entrapment is love: the passion of a willful shepherd for a shrewd bourgeois housewife; of a vital young woman for a dashing Russian who has come to work in the local factory; of a steadfast son for his aged mother. Lives are lost and hearts are broken, and, always, love is a transcending form of grace. In <i>Once in Europa</i>, it speaks as plainly and as movingly as a remembered language, creating a work of astonishing tenderness.</p><p>John Berger was born in London and now lives in a small village in the French Alps.

But that&#x2019;s not all that awaits them. The Titan lord, Kronos, has set up his most devious trap yet, and the young heroes have just fallen prey. Hilarious and action-packed, this third adventure in the series finds Percy faced with his most dangerous challenge so far: the chilling prophecy of the Titan&#x2019;s curse.</p><p>Rick Riordan is the author of <i>Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book One: The Lightning Thief</i>, and <i>Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book Two: The Sea of Monsters</i>, both available on audio from Listening Library. His previous novels for adults include the hugely popular Tres Navarre series, winner of the top three awards in the mystery genre. He lives in San Antonio, Texas, with his wife and two sons.Sounding alternately young, or old, or really scary, Jesse Bernstein narrates the third installment of the adventures of teenaged demi-god Percy Jackson and his friends. Facing the potential destruction of Mount Olympus by an ancient monster, Percy teams up with a group of Artemis&#39;s hunters to rescue the goddess, and save his friend Annabeth along the way. But their quest seems doomed from the beginning, and Bernstein effectively voices the confusion and loss the team experiences. This book is tied closely to the preceding books in the Olympians series; thus, some story lines are understood better with background.

Revealing Andrew Jackson's central role in the government's policies, Wallace examines the racist attitudes toward Native Americans that led to their removal and, ultimately, their tragic fate.</p></p><p><p><b>Anthony F.C. Wallace</b> is a professor of history and anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania. He is the author of many books, including <i>Rockdale, </i>which won the Bancroft Prize in 1978. He lives in Pennsylvania.</p>Wallace, who won a Bancroft Prize in 1978 for Rockdale: The Growth of an American Village , turns to Native American history in this retelling of the story of the Trail of Tears. This refers to the forced removal in the 1830s of thousands of Indians, particularly the Cherokee and the Choctaw, from the American east to west of the Mississippi River. The author expands his focus to examine the relocation of numerous Indian groups. Central to the story is Andrew Jackson, who assumed the presidency confronted with a government divided over the question of Indian removal and who soon became one of its major proponents. Responses of the Natives ranged from legal action and ultimate resignation on the part of some to warfare on the part of the Seminole. In a concluding chapter, Wallace shows how the effects of removal continue to the present day. All of this is told in a straightforward manner. Although he points to certain well-known white historians who give short shrift to this history, he overstates the uniqueness of his study. While it is a good introduction to the topic, this volume is far from the only modern historical treatment. Two documentary appendixes will be helpful to readers new to the subject. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Winter Frost</h2><p>In this fifth novel in the DI Jack Frost series, a serial killer surfaces in Denton, killing prostitutes and abducting small girls.

Written by Elizabeth Isichei, a leading scholar in this field, A History of Christianity in Africa examines the origins and development of Christianity in Africa from the early story of Egyptian Christianity to the spectacular growth, vitality, and diversity of the churches in Africa today.<br><br> Isichei opens with the brilliance of Christianity in Africa in antiquity and shows how Christian Egypt and North Africa produced some of the most influential intellects of the time. She then discusses the churches founded in the wake of early contacts with Europe, from the late fifteenth century on, and the unbroken Christian witness of Coptic Egypt and of Ethiopia. Isichei also examines the different types of Christianity in modern Africa and shows how social factors have influenced its development and expression.<br><br> With the explosive growth of Christianity now taking place in Africa and the increasingly recognized significance of African Christianity, this much-needed book fills the void in scholarly works on that continent's Christian past, also foreshadowing Christian Africa's influential future.</p><p>Professor of religious studies at Otago University inDunedin, New Zealand. She has written widely onChristianity in Africa for academic journals and taught inAfrican universities for sixteen years.The word <i>encyclopedic</i> seems somehow inadequate for a book whose subject spans 2,000 years on a continent as large and diverse as Africa, a continent where--by some estimates--Christianity is expanding at a rate roughly double that at which it is declining in the Western world. But it is probably the best word available to convey the scope and style of Isichei's book, which is informative and readable and will surely become an important reference for historians and others interested in Africa, in Christianity, or in both. But as important as what it contains is what it does. Much of Christianity's history in Africa and elsewhere is inscribed in the tragic consequences of its confusion and entanglement with European culture and colonialism. By chronicling diverse African struggles to disentangle and encounter it anew, and by teasing out a thread of descent that predates colonialism, Isichei lays a foundation for a more conscious and critical encounter with Christianity's enculturation outside Africa as well as in. That is a welcome contribution to the understanding of Africa and Christianity, a corrective to a history of interpretation that has too often confused them with their "inventions" by the West. <i>Steve Schroeder</i></p><h2>Naked Money: A Revealing Look at What It Is and Why It Matters</h2><p><p><strong>The best-selling <em>Naked</em> series tackles the weird world of money.</strong></p><p>Consider the $20 bill.</p><p>It has no more value, as a simple slip of paper, than Monopoly money. Yet even children recognize that tearing one into small pieces is an act of inconceivable stupidity. What makes a $20 bill actually worth twenty dollars? In the third volume of his best-selling <em>Naked</em> series, Charles Wheelan uses this seemingly simple question to open the door to the surprisingly colorful world of money and banking.</p><p>The search for an answer triggers countless other questions along the way: Why does paper money (&#x201c;fiat currency&#x201d; if you want to be fancy) even exist? And why do some nations, like Zimbabwe in the 1990s, print so much of it that it becomes more valuable as toilet paper than as currency? How do central banks use the power of money creation to stop financial crises? Why does most of Europe share a common currency, and why has that arrangement caused so much trouble? And will payment apps, bitcoin, or other new technologies render all of this moot?</p><p>In <em>Naked Money</em>, Wheelan tackles all of the above and more, showing us how our banking and monetary systems should work in ideal situations and revealing the havoc and suffering caused in real situations by inflation, deflation, illiquidity, and other monetary effects. Throughout, Wheelan&#x2019;s uniquely bright-eyed, whimsical style brings levity and clarity to a subject often devoid of both. With illuminating stories from Argentina, Zimbabwe, North Korea, America, China, and elsewhere around the globe, Wheelan demystifies the curious world behind the paper in our wallets and the digits in our bank accounts.</p></p><p>Charles Wheelan is the author of the best-selling Naked Statistics and Naked Economics and is a former correspondent for The Economist.

And when the carnage is done, only one survivor remains: a young boy named Kieli. A youth no longer, there is now but one road for him to travel: the path of vengeance. And he willnot be alone. Under the tutelage of the rescuerswho discovered him, Kieli will be molded into a sure and pitiless weapon. And he will accept the destiny that has been chosen for him ... asTalon of the Silver Hawk.</p><p>But the prey he so earnestly stalks is hunting himas well. And Talon must swear allegiance toa shadowy cause that already binds his mysterious benefactors -- or his mission, his honor,and his life will be lost forever.</p></p><p><p><strong>Raymond E. Feist</strong> is the author of more than 30 previous books, including the internationally bestselling &#x201c;Riftwar Cycle&#x201d; of novels set in his signature world of Midkemia. The Firemane Saga is his first all-new epic fantasy series. He lives in San Diego, California.</p>A prolific purveyor of solid conventional fantasy launches a new Midkemia saga, Conclave of Shadows. Kieli, a young boy of the mountain-dwelling Orosini, is the sole survivor of a massacre of his people by ruthless mercenaries. From a bird that visits him when he thinks he is dying, he takes the name Talon of the Silver Hawk, and re-enters civilization with a vague notion of destiny and the grimly focused aspiration to avenge his people. As he matures, he is drawn into the arms of a good many women and even farther into the machinations of the sorcerers of the Shadow Conclave, headed by Pug and Miranda, old friends to fans of previous Midkemia sagas. Talon learns that he has both human and magical foes, and he becomes a deadly swordsman to function in the role of one of the conclave's agents. By the end of this book, he has achieved at least one of his goals but faces a whole new set of perils that begins with swearing allegiance to the formidable duke of Olasko. Further volumes in Talon's tale are to come from other accomplished fantasists, including S. M. Stirling and Joel Rosenberg, so the prognosis is highly favorable for continued good reading for dedicated Midkemians, many of whom could start with this book that stands well alone and is noticeably smoother reading than a goodly portion of Feist's other work. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Kazantzakis&#39; writings are an anguished expression of the eternal struggle between the spirit and flesh, and he uses the story of St Francis to draw us into the Maelstrom. The story is dramatically unfolded to us by the Saint&#39;s constant companion, Frate Leone, who takes us through agonies of physical and spiritual humiliation. We accompany the Saint before the Pope to establish his Brotherhood; to Damietta and the Saracen armies; and in solitary vigils on Mount Alvernia. The minutest and the mightiest elements of nature form the backcloth to the drama of events. Hate, compassion, jealousy and fear are among the principal ingredients in the drama, fused together with infinite subtlety.</p><p>Nikos Kazantzakis was born in 1883 in Herakleion on the island of Crete. During the Cretan revolt of 1897 his family was sent to the island of Naxos, where he attended the French School of the Holy Cross. From 1902 to 1906 he studied law at Athens University. He worked first as a journalist and throughout a long career wrote several plays, travel journals and translations. His remarkable travels began in 1907 and there were few countries in Europe or Asia that he didn't visit. He studied Buddhism in Vienna and later belonged to a group of radical intellectuals in Berlin, where he began his great epic <b>The Odyssey</b>, which he completed in 1938. He didn't start writing novels until he was almost 60 and completed his most famous work, <b>Zorba the Greek</b>, in 1946. Other novels include <b>Freedom and Death</b> (1953) and <b>The Last Temptation</b> (1954), which the Vatican placed on the Index. <b>Return to Greco</b>, an autobiographical novel, was published in 1961.Nikos Kazantzakis finally settled in Antibes with his second wife, and died there from leukaemia in October 1957. He is buried at Herakleion, where the epitaph on his tomb reads: 'I hope for nothing. I fear nothing. I am free'.</p><h2>Ecstatic Body Postures: An Alternate Reality Workbook</h2><p>Specific body postures reappear in the art and artifacts of world cultures, even those widely separated by time and distance.

Written in Chinese from a Chinese point of view for a Chinese audience, <i>From the Soil</i> describes the contrasting organizational principles of Chinese and Western societies, thereby conveying the essential features of both. Fei shows how these unique features reflect and are reflected in the moral and ethical characters of people in these societies. This profound, challenging book is both succinct and accessible. In its first complete English-language edition, it is likely to have a wide impact on Western social theorists.<br><br>Gary G. Hamilton and Wang Zheng's translation captures Fei's jargonless, straightforward style of writing. Their introduction describes Fei's education and career as a sociologist, the fate of his writings on and off the Mainland, and the sociological significance of his analysis. The translators' epilogue highlights the social reforms for China that Fei drew from his analysis and advocated in a companion text written in the same period.</p><p>"A lucid and fascinating work about Chinese society and values.

Pounding the mean streets of the Empire's capital, he takes apart the pretensions, addictions, and cruelties of its inhabitants with perfect comic timing and killer punchlines. Social climbers and sex-offenders, rogue traders and two-faced preachers - all are subject to his forensic annihilations and often foul-mouthed verses. Packed with incident and detail, Martial's epigrams bring Rome vividly to life in all its variety; biting satire rubs alongside tender friendship, lust for life beside sorrow for loss. Gossipy, clever, and above all entertaining, they express amusement as much as indignation at the vices they expose. <br><br>This selection brings Martial to a twenty-first century readership in a prose translation that pulls no punches and presents him in all his moods. It establishes his originality as a literary author, and the significance of his achievement as the poet who conquered epigram for Rome.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES:</strong><br>For over 100 years <em>Oxford World's Classics</em> has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p><br><strong>Gideon Nisbet</strong> has taught and researched the classical world and its reception at the Universities of Glasgow, Reading, Warwick, and Oxford, and is an expert in ancient epigram.

Gideon Nisbet&#39;s version of Martial&#39;s Rome and Martial&#39;s world is enjoyable and lively. * Carmen Fenechiu, Journal of Ancient History and Archeology * Martial is an epigrammatist of unmatched range and brilliance. Treating life, society and human foibles with coruscating wit, he mixes vicious abuse, frequently sexual, of individuals with biting satire on human weakness and lyrical reflections on Rome, friendship and country life. In his extremely useful edition Gideon Nisbet selects over 300 of his subject&#39;s c. 1600 poems, doing full justice to Martial&#39;s range. * Peter Jones, Classics for All *</p><h2>Meaning-Based Translation: A Guide to Cross-Language Equivalence, 2nd edition</h2><p>Meaning-Based Translation is designed for training beginning translators and organized chapter by chapter as drill material for the textbook Meaning-Based Translation.

In it, McNeill challenges the Spengler-Toynbee view that a number of separate civilizations pursued essentially independent careers, and argues instead that human cultures interacted at every stage of their history. The author suggests that from the Neolithic beginnings of grain agriculture to the present major social changes in all parts of the world were triggered by new or newly important foreign stimuli, and he presents a persuasive narrative of world history to support this claim. <br><br>In a retrospective essay titled "<i>The Rise of the West</i> after Twenty-five Years," McNeill shows how his book was shaped by the time and place in which it was written (1954-63). He discusses how historiography subsequently developed and suggests how his portrait of the world's past in The Rise of the West should be revised to reflect these changes. <br><br>"This is not only the most learned and the most intelligent, it is also the most stimulating and fascinating book that has ever set out to recount and explain the whole history of mankind. . . .

This book argues that this notion is a moral illusion: no one has ever possessed that sort of authority.</p><p>MICHAEL HUEMER received his BA from UC Berkeley in 1992 and his PhD from Rutgers University in 1998. He is presently professor of philosophy at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He is the author of more than 50 academic articles in ethics, epistemology, political philosophy, and metaphysics, as well as three brilliant and fascinating books that everyone should buy: <i>Skepticism and the Veil of Perception</i> (2001), <i>Ethical Intuitionism</i> (2005), and <i>The Problem of Political Authority</i> (2013).&#39;Huemer has produced not just a brilliant work of political philosophy, but a gripping page-turner. With an engaging style and sharp wit, Huemer demolishes two entrenched dogmas: that we have a duty to obey the law, and the state has the right to force us to obey. Huemer&#39;s conclusions may be controversial, but he makes them seem like commonsense.&#39; - Jason Brennan, Georgetown University, USA &#39;Michael Huemer is my favorite philosopher. The Problem of Political Authority is his best book yet. Using moral premises you probably already accept, and clear but subtle arguments, Huemer leads you step-by-step to a radical yet compelling conclusion: government as we know it is an unnecessary evil.

He takes seriously Hegel's claim that art has exhausted its spiritual vocation, that it is no longer through art that Spirit principally comes to knowledge of itself. He argues, however, that Hegel by no means proclaimed the "death of art" (as many still imagine) but proclaimed rather the indefinite continuation of art in what Hegel called a "self-annulling" mode.<br>With astonishing breadth and originality, the author probes the meaning, aesthetics, and historical consequences of that self-annulment. In essence, he argues that the birth of modern aesthetics is the result of a series of schisms&#x2015;between artist and spectator, genius and taste, and form and matter, for example&#x2015;that are manifestations of the deeper, self-negating yet self-perpetuating movement of irony. <br>Through this concept of self-annulment, the author offers an imaginative reinterpretation of the history of aesthetic theory from Kant to Heidegger, and he opens up original perspectives on such phenomena as the rise of the modern museum, the link between art and terror, the natural affinity between "good taste" and its perversion, and kitsch as the inevitable destiny of art in the modern era. The final chapter offers a dazzling interpretation of D�rer's <i>Melancholia</i> in the terms that the book has articulated as its own.<br><i>The Man Without Content</i> will naturally interest those who already prize Agamben's work, but it will also make his name relevant to a whole new audience&#x2015;those involved with art, art history, the history of aesthetics, and popular culture.</p><p></p><h2>Schooling America: How the Public Schools Meet the Nation&#39;s Changing Needs (Institutions of American Democracy)</h2><p>In this informative volume, Patricia Graham, one of America's most esteemed historians of education, offers a vibrant history of American education in the last century. Drawing on a wide array of sources, from government reports to colorful anecdotes, Graham skillfully illustrates Americans' changing demands for our schools, and how schools have responded by providing what critics want, though never as completely or as quickly as they would like.<br><br>In 1900, as waves of immigrants arrived, the American public wanted schools to assimilate students into American life, combining the basics of English and arithmetic with emphasis on patriotism, hard work, fair play, and honesty. In the 1920s, the focus shifted from schools serving a national need to serving individual needs; education was to help children adjust to life. By 1954 the emphasis moved to access, particularly for African-American children to desegregated classrooms, but also access to special programs for the gifted, the poor, the disabled, and non-English speakers. Now Americans want achievement for all, defined as higher test scores. While presenting this intricate history, Graham introduces us to the passionate educators, scholars, and journalists who drove particular agendas, as well as her own family, starting with her immigrant father's first day of school and ending with her own experiences as a teacher.<br><br>Invaluable background in the ongoing debate on education in the United States, this book offers an insightful look at what the public has sought from its educational institutions, what educators have delivered, and what remains to be done.<br></p><p><br><strong>Patricia Albjerg Graham</strong> is the Charles Warren Research Professor of the History of American Education at Harvard University and formerly Director of the National Institute of Education.

Symonds presents a masterful history of the Civil War navies--both Union and Confederate--and places them within the broader context of the emerging industrial age. <br><br>Symonds begins with an account of the dramatic pre-war revolution in naval technology--the advent of steam propulsion, the screw propeller, and larger and more powerful rifled guns that could fire explosive shells as well as solid shot. These extraordinary changes were epitomized in the famous "Battle of the Ironclads"--one of the great stories of the Civil War--pitting USS <em>Monitor</em> against the larger and more heavily armed CSS <em>Virginia</em> (also known as <em>Merrimack</em>). Symonds also offers an overview of Lincoln's blockade of the South, a vast campaign involving as many as 500 ships and 100,000 men; discusses the fierce naval war for control of the rivers in the West; and looks at the important siege of Charleston, which would last three years and involve 40,000 men and sixty warships. Symonds concludes with three key episodes from the end of the war--the dramatic Battle of Mobile Bay, where Farragut delivered his famous cry: "Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!"; the battle of Wilmington, where combined naval and army forces successfully overran Fort Fisher, a giant earthwork fort called by one historian "the mightiest fortress in America"; and the remarkable cruise of the CSS Shenandoah, a round-the-world voyage of 58,000 miles, during which she captured thirty-eight prizes--mostly after Lee had surrendered, alas. <br><br><em>The Civil War at Sea</em> illuminates a little-discussed and greatly undervalued aspect of America's national conflict. Concise yet comprehensive, this volume is a lively addition to the field of naval history.<br></p><p><p>The first time American naval power was deployed to its full potential, with American warships playing essential roles in military campaigns, America was at war with itself. And by the end of the Civil War, the foundation of modern naval warfare&#x2014;the ships, the weapons, the tactics&#x2014;would be firmly established.</p><br><strong>Craig L.

Ever moving and ever changing in mood, it is a place without time, in contrast to the land which is fixed and scarred by human activity giving it a visible history. While the land is familiar, even reassuring, the sea is unknown and threatening. By taking to the sea humans put themselves at its mercy. It has often been perceived to be an alien power teasing and cajoling. The sea may give but it takes.<br><br>Why, then, did humans become seafarers? Part of the answer is that we are conditioned by our genetics to be acquisitive animals: we like to acquire rare materials and we are eager for esoteric knowledge, and society rewards us well for both. Looking out to sea most will be curious as to what is out there--a mysterious island perhaps but what lies beyond? Our innate inquisitiveness drives us to explore.<br><br>Barry Cunliffe looks at the development of seafaring on the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, two contrasting seas-- the Mediterranean without a significant tide, enclosed and soon to become familiar, the Atlantic with its frightening tidal ranges, an ocean without end. We begin with the Middle Palaeolithic hunter gatherers in the eastern Mediterranean building simple vessels to make their remarkable crossing to Crete and we end in the early years of the sixteenth century with sailors from Spain, Portugal and England establishing the limits of the ocean from Labrador to Patagonia. The message is that the contest between humans and the sea has been a driving force, perhaps the driving force, in human history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Barry Cunliffe</strong> taught archaeology in the Universities of Bristol and Southampton and was Professor of European Archaeology at the University of Oxford from 1972 to 2008, thereafter becoming Emeritus Professor.

And why, despite this difficulty, are some people so good at it? If there's some inborn capacity for mathematical thinking&#x2014;which there must be, otherwise no one could do it &#x2014;why can't we all do it well? Keith Devlin has answers to all these difficult questions, and in giving them shows us how mathematical ability evolved, why it's a part of language ability, and how we can make better use of this innate talent.He also offers a breathtakingly new theory of language development&#x2014;that language evolved in two stages, and its main purpose was not communication&#x2014;to show that the ability to think mathematically arose out of the same symbol-manipulating ability that was so crucial to the emergence of true language. Why, then, can't we do math as well as we can speak? The answer, says Devlin, is that we can and do&#x2014;we just don't recognize when we're using mathematical reasoning.</p><p>For many, the mere word "mathematics" is enough to conjure memories of incomprehension at school, and fear and loathing ever afterward. Countless otherwise well-educated people see mathematics as the skeleton in their intellectual closet--the one key subject demanding a talent that they so obviously did not possess.<p> Or so it seems to anyone who has felt very much on the outside of the subject. British mathematician Keith Devlin is certainly on the inside, and in <i>The Math Gene</i>, he has wonderful news for everyone: we can all join him there. For Devlin argues that we all possess the ability to cope with mathematics--if only we recognize what's required. While a number of recent books, notably Stanislas Dehaene's <i>The Number Sense</i>, have focused on numerical ability, the scope of Devlin's book is much larger. He examines the evidence that we all possess, if not literally a gene, then at least an inherent ability not just for arithmetic but for real mathematics: algebra, calculus, and the rest. Devlin even puts forward a Darwinian explanation for the origin of this ability, based on the idea that being able to handle abstract ideas and relationships confers key evolutionary advantages.</p><p> Mathematics merely involves a relatively high level of abstraction--but one we can all cope with, if we work at it. "Doing mathematics is very much like running a marathon," writes Devlin. "It does not require any special talent, and 'finishing' is largely a matter of wanting to succeed."</p><p> In its wealth of wonderful examples supporting the central argument, <i>The Math Gene</i> bears comparison with Steven Pinker's <i>The Language Instinct</i>, and its plain common sense about this most misunderstood of subjects is inspirational. Thoroughly recommended for anyone seeking to rid their intellectual closet of the skeleton of mathematical "incompetence." <i>--Robert Matthews, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><b>Keith Devlin</b> is the Dean of the School of Social Science at St. Mary's College, Moraga, California, and a Senior Researcher at the Center for the Study of Language and Information at Stanford University.

How can you be one? Is a job candidate an effective leader who can work with students and staff in your school or district? According to author Jeffrey Glanz, each of us has natural leadership abilities. Although no single leadership style is better than another, matching a person&#39;s style with an assignment leads to success for the person, his colleagues, and the organization. The key is to identify and actualize each person&#39;s natural leadership style. Full descriptions of the seven types of leaders-Dynamic Aggressives, Dynamic Assertives, Dynamic Supportives, Adaptive Aggressives, Adaptive Assertives, Adaptive Supportives, and Creative Assertives-afford valuable insight into your own behaviors and the strengths of those around you. Glanz uses vivid, authentic scenarios to illustrate the qualities of each leadership type, and identifies seven virtues that are critical for all leaders and yet are often overlooked in educational leadership programs. An invaluable aid to teachers, supervisors, and district leaders, this book provides questionnaires and focus questions to help you analyze leadership potential in yourself and in colleagues. The author also shows you how to go about the crucial process of matching leadership qualities with specific jobs in the educational system, from teacher to superintendent. Understanding the natural leadership qualities and virtues helps you to create an educational environment that is characterized by excellence.</p><p></p><h2>Strunk&#39;s Source Readings in Music History: The Nineteenth Century (Source Readings Vol. 6)</h2><p><p><strong>The definitive collection of great writings on music of the nineteenth century.</strong></p> Forty-five years after the appearance of the first edition, Oliver Strunk's monumental anthology of writings about music has been thoroughly revised and extended by a team of scholars working under the direction of musicologist Leo Treitler.

Within moments Romm found himself hanging by the straps of his parachute, with a broken arm and a leg shattered in a dozen places, looking down from 10,000 feet.

Incomparable and unprecedented in Hungarian literature, Prae compels recognition as a serious contribution to modernist fiction, as ambitious in its aspirations as Ulysses or � la recherche du temps perdu. With no traditional narration and no psychologically motivated characters, in playing with voices, temporality, and events, while fiction, Prae is more what Northrop Frye calls an anatomy (� la Lucian, Rabelais, &amp; Burton) or Menippean satire: the basic concern of the book is intellectual, its pervading mood is that of a comedy of ideas. As a virtual novel that preempts every possibility for its realization, it is a novel but only virtually so, a book which is actually a prae-paration for an unwritten (unwritable) novel. In this, it maintains the freedom and openness of its potentialities, indicative for instance in the Non-Prae diagonals, a series of passages that intercut the novel and continually fracture space and time to engage in what one of the figures of the book calls the culture of wordplay or dogmatic accidentalism. "The book's title," said Szentkuthy, "alludes to it being an overture. A multitude of thoughts, emotions, ideas, fantasies, and motifs that mill and churn as chimes, an overture to my subsequent oeuvre." By challenging the then prevailing dogmas and conventions of prose writing, Szentkuthy was said to have created a new canon for himself but later derided as insignificant for supposedly not acquiring followers. Largely unread at the time, Prae eventually gained cult status and would be reprinted in 1980 and 2004. To some critics, the book is not only one of the representative experimental works of the early 20th century, but in its attempt to bring 'impossible literature' into being, it also presages the nouveau roman by almost 30 years. And in its rejection of sequentiality and celebration of narrative shuffling, long before Burroughs &amp; Gysin, Prae enacts what is conceptually akin to the cut-up. Few of Szentkuthy's contemporaries would reveal with equal bravura and audacity the new horizons that were opened up for narrative forms after the era of realism. In Frivolities &amp; Confessions, Szentkuthy said that his goal with Prae was "to absorb the problems of modern philosophy and mathematics into modern fashion, love, and every manifestation of life." Translated for the first time since its original publication in 1934, upon its 80th anniversary, this legendary and controversial Hungarian modernist novel is now at last available in English.</p><p></p><h2>Strong: Nine Workout Programs for Women to Burn Fat, Boost Metabolism, and Build Strength for Life</h2><p><b>A groundbreaking strength and conditioning plan for women, from the authors of <i>The New Rules of Lifting for Women</i>.</b><br><b> &nbsp;</b><br> Forget the elliptical machine and the candy-colored Barbie weights.

It was late summer 2009. &#x201c;The arthritis in my knees was getting so bad my doctor was ready to put me on constant pain meds,&#x201d; she told me recently. &#x201c;I told him I&#x2019;d think about it and get back to him.&#x201d; Thinking about it meant research. Research convinced her that it was time to take action. Specifically, to strengthen her muscles with a serious training program. That led her to <i>The New Rules of Lifting for Women</i>, a book my coauthors and I had published the year before. We wrote it for a simple reason: Readers asked us for it. They asked because the guidance women received from the media, from their peers, and even from fitness professionals in health clubs was the opposite of what we provided for men.<br> &nbsp;<br> This was despite the fact there was no reason to give different advice to men and women. Exercise science had concluded long before that the muscles of men and women are exactly the same. Your muscles and my muscles perform the same actions and produce the same movements. Pound for pound, they generate the same amount of force. When trained, they respond equally well. But here&#x2019;s the worst part: This wasn&#x2019;t secret information. Everyone who wrote about strength training or trained female athletes or worked with female clients either knew or should have known.<br> &nbsp;<br> The exercises in <i>NROL for Women </i>weren&#x2019;t the ones readers like Dana were used to seeing in books and magazines. She&#x2019;d never done a push-up before, or a deadlift, or a squat with a barbell on her back. And the advice to focus on strength and muscle development, rather than &#x201c;toning&#x201d; and &#x201c;shaping,&#x201d; was a paradigm shift for women who&#x2019;d developed an irrational fear of &#x201c;bulking up&#x201d; if they lifted anything bigger than their forearms or heavier than a purse. <br> &nbsp;<br> So on September 9, 2009, Dana tried it. Arthritic joints and all. She could barely bend her knees on the squat and had to do her push-ups against a kitchen counter. But by the end of the program, she could do eight push-ups. <i>Traditional </i>push-ups, with her hands and toes on the floor. She could lift a 135-pound barbell off the ground and squat with 100 pounds on her back. And those pain meds her doctor was about to prescribe? Turns out, she didn&#x2019;t need them. She just needed to get strong.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Anyone who actually finishes the program comes out a changed person,&#x201d; she told me. &#x201c;Most of us never knew how strong we could be. It opened doors we didn&#x2019;t even know were there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> OUR GREATEST MISTAKE<br> &nbsp;<br> Here&#x2019;s the irony of Dana&#x2019;s transformation: We never thought readers like her would pick up the book. The original title, <i>Lift Like a Man, Look Like a Goddess</i>, signaled our goal of reaching women who were already working out but not getting the results they wanted. I saw countless women like that in the gym. They were healthy and appeared able and willing to work hard toward their goals, but did so with workouts that were unlikely to help them accomplish anything useful. Those are the readers who contacted Alwyn and me when we published <i>The New Rules of Lifting</i>, our first book together, in 2006.<br> &nbsp;<br> To our delight, <i>NROL for Women </i>(the title we very wisely switched to after the book was already written and photographed) reached that target audience. We heard from readers who&#x2019;d lost fat, improved their physiques in noticeable ways, and found they enjoyed doing the type of workouts we provided for guys in the original <i>NROL</i>.<br><br> But we also heard from readers like Dana, who was so excited by her progress that she started a Facebook group for her fellow lifters. Beyond their gender and the fact that they love lifting heavy things, they have little in common. In fact, these days I rarely hear from anyone who fits my original concept. Our universe of lifters includes women from their twenties to their seventies. From competitive athletes to complete beginners. From underweight to severely obese. From healthy to anything but.</p><h2>The Emerald Horizon: The History of Nature in Iowa (Bur Oak Book)</h2><p>In <i>The Emerald Horizon</i>, Cornelia Mutel combines lyrical writing with meticulous scientific research to portray the environmental past, present, and future of Iowa. In doing so, she ties all of Iowa's natural features into one comprehensive whole.<br><br>Since so much of the tallgrass state has been transformed into an agricultural landscape, Mutel focuses on understanding today&#x2019;s natural environment by understanding yesterday&#x2019;s changes. After summarizing the geological, archaeological, and ecological features that shaped Iowa&#x2019;s modern landscape, she recreates the once-wild native communities that existed prior to Euroamerican settlement. Next she examines the dramatic changes that overtook native plant and animal communities as Iowa&#x2019;s prairies, woodlands, and wetlands were transformed. Finally she presents realistic techniques for restoring native species and ecological processes as well as a broad variety of ways in which Iowans can reconnect with the natural world. Throughout, in addition to the many illustrations commissioned for this book, she offers careful scientific exposition, a strong sense of respect for the land, and encouragement to protect the future by learning from the past.<br><br>The &#x201c;emerald prairie&#x201d; that &#x201c;gleamed and shone to the horizon&#x2019;s edge,&#x201d; as botanist Thomas Macbride described it in 1895, has vanished. Cornelia Mutel&#x2019;s passionate dedication to restoring this damaged landscape&#x2014;and by extension the transformed landscape of the entire Corn Belt&#x2014;invigorates her blend of natural history and human history. Believing that citizens who are knowledgeable about native species, communities, and ecological processes will better care for them, she gives us hope&#x2014;and sound suggestions&#x2014;for the future.</p><p>Ecologist Cornelia Mutel is the historian and archivist for IIHR-Hydroscience and Engineering at the University of Iowa College of Engineering.

She was one of the foremost writers on food in the latter half of the 20th century and this book has her most celebrated writing. "French Provincial Cooking" should be approached and read as a series of short stories, as well written and evocative as the best literature. <br><br>The voice is highly personal and opinionated, sometimes sharp but always true and always entertaining. Here is a long essay on French cuisine, offering background stories and sketches of recipes more than the slavishly didactic type of recipes that most modern readers might be used to today. For many Elizabeth David was the first to introduce us to the French notion of la cuisine terroir, sometimes interpreted as 'what grows together goes together'. For David, this is the heart of regional cooking, and the thing which most distinguishes it from cooking in haute cuisine restaurants where diners arrive at any time or any season and expect to be able to order any well known French specialty. <br><br>One of the passages which best characterizes David's approach to a lot of cooking is her opening statement on the perfect omelet: 'As everybody knows, there is only one infallible recipe for the perfect omelet: your own.' <br><br>The book starts with a short essay on each of the major culinary regions of France, starting perhaps not surprisingly with Provence which is blessed an abundance of produce. The largest portion of the book consists of chapters on cuisine by type of dish: Sauces, Hors-D'oeuvres and Salads, Soups, Eggs and Cheese, Pates and Terrines, Vegetables, Fish, Shellfish, Meat, Composite Meat Dishes, Poultry and Game, and Sweet dishes. <br><br>The book is all the more valuable in that it paints a picture of a cooking style which existed before modern equipment such as the food processor. Most importantly, the recipes work if your aim is to produce the most excellent food imaginable. What initially may seem to be annoying details (e.g., for omelets, eggs 'should not really be beaten at all, but stirred,' whereas for scrambled eggs, they should be 'very well beaten') are actually secrets to be treasured, that elevate a good dish to a superb one. The lesson is that good food should be done simply, but it takes care, attention to detail, and frequently, time. <br><br>A hardback edition of French Provincial Cooking has been unavailable for many years and Grub Street is re-issuing it because of overwhelming demand. It should become as popular an edition as the best-selling "Elizabeth David Classics".</p><p>Elizabeth David lived and kept house in France, Italy, Greece, Egypt and India, learning the local dishes and cooking them in her own kitchens. Her first book, Mediterranean Food, appeared in 1950. In 1951 French Country Cooking was published and in 1954, after a year of research in Italy, Italian Food. This was followed by Summer Cooking (1955), French Provincial Cooking (1960) and Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen (1970). In 1973 Mrs David severed all connection with the business trading under her name and concentrated on study and experiment for English Bread and Yeast Cookery, for which she won the 1977 Glenfiddich Writer of the Year Award. An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, a selection of her journalistic work, was published in 1984 and Harvest of the Cold Months, her book on the use of ice and the making of ices was edited by Jill Norman and published posthumously in 1994. She was honoured with many prizes, made Chevalier de l&#39;Ordre du Merite Agricole by the French in 1977, awarded the OBE in 1976 and the CBE in 1986. Honorary doctorates were conferred on her by the universities of Essex and Bristol. In 1982 she was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. She died on 22 May 1992.France and Italy are especially famous for wine and food. David studies and analyzes cooking the way a scholar analyzes literature, and, as a result, her titles are far more than just cookbooks. Along with the recipes, of which there are many, she explains at length the histories of the dishes and offers splendid advice on serving wine with the meals. Both volumes, published in 1960 and 1958, respectively, contain forewords by Julia Child. Italian Food was the author's personal favorite.<br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A New Home for Lily (The Adventures of Lily Lapp)</h2><p>Lily Lapp is moving with her family to Pennsylvania to join a new Amish community.

Historians have portrayed Tecumseh, the war leader, as the key figure in forging the intertribal confederacy. In this full-length biography of Tenskwatawa, R.

Bill Albert is the coauthor, with his wife, of more than sixty novels for young adults. They live in the Texas hill country.In Paige's middling 11th historical (after 2004's <i>Death in Hyde Park</i>), detecting couple Lord Charles and Kate Sheridan are guests in 1903 at Blenheim Palace, hereditary home of the dukes of Marlborough, when one of the maids disappears. A greater disturbance erupts when another woman vanishes&#x2014;the mistress of the current duke&#x2014;amid signs of possible foul play. With a royal visit on the horizon, the Sheridans, a devoted pair (though lacking the depth of David Dickinson's Powerscourts in his historical series set in the same period), enlist the aid of an eager young T.E. Lawrence, who goes undercover on the palace's staff. Lawrence, with improbable speed, manages to gain the trust of a crooked servant implicated in a burglary ring specializing in the theft of precious stones. There's little mystery about the murderer's identity, though a major, and more interesting, enigma remains unresolved, until perhaps the next book in the series. Winston Churchill buffs might find his featured role of interest, but the historical loom on which this tale is spun is just not sturdy enough. <i>(Feb. 1)</i><br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Everything was going fine for a while, and then things got bad. Considered one of the best in the <i>Parker </i>series, <i>The Score</i> is the perfect vehicle for Darwyn Cooke to pull out all the stops and let loose with a book that has all the impact of a brutal kick to the solar plexus!</li></ul></p><p><b>Richard Stark</b>&nbsp;is the most famous pseudonym of world-renowned author Donald Westlake (1933-2008). In 1962 hecreated the master thief Parker and began a series of novels that have been recognized as seminal works of crime fiction. Several of Westlake&#x2019;s books have been adapted by Hollywood and Westlake&#x2019;s adaptation of The Grifters earned him an Academy Award nomination for best motion picture screenplay. Westlake has won numerous awards for his fiction and in 1993 the Mystery Writers of America named him a Grand Master, the highest honor bestowed by that prestigious society.<br><br><b>Darwyn Cooke</b>&nbsp;(1962-2015) was a graphic designer and animator who turned his attention toward cartooning in the late nineties. Known primarily for his work on the DC line of superheroes, Cooke always had an affinity for crime fiction and has often cited the Parker books as a great source of creative inspiration. Cooke has won multiple Eisner, Harvey, and Shuster awards, as well as the National Cartoonist Society&#x2019;s Best Series award. In 2008 Cooke was Emmy-nominated for the animated adaptation of his magnum opus,&nbsp;<i>DC:&nbsp;The New Frontier.</i>Cooke rolls out another savvy effort in this third adaptation of the classic Parker thrillers by Richard Stark (aka Donald E. Westlake). As adept an adapter as he is an artist, Cooke knows just when to let his retro-sophisticated drawings do the talking and when to let Stark&#x2019;s words take over. Because, in any case, they both hammer home the same point: you do not mess with Parker. This story brings the professional thief in on an elaborate scheme to rob an entire town blind in one fell swoop. That means a lot of people need to be involved, which isn&#x2019;t Parker&#x2019;s style, but the sheer audacity of it all proves an irresistible temptress. With a dozen microlocations and at least as many important players, the machinery of the heist could easily have compromised the tension of the story. But Cooke stages it all like a pro, nimbly guiding readers through the intricate plot, and it&#x2019;s a blast. Another notch in the belt for one of comics&#x2019; hardest-boiled crime series, and more evidence for the court as to Cooke&#x2019;s skill and the strength of the source material. --Ian Chipman</p><h2>Wedge Quilt Workshop: Step-by-Step Tutorials 10 Stunning Projects</h2><p>A quick path to a bold quilt design, wedges are versatile and captivating&#x2015;a must-have shape in the modern quilter's toolbox.

My mind, my heart.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At just past 6:00 p.m., the sky was black, and the icy January air hovered over the ground as a thick, misty fog. Snow clung to the dirt in patches, and my heart felt as dead as the wintry world around me. Silently, I trudged through the park and tugged my knit gloves tighter. I wanted only to be happy and for life to be a little easier, but everything seemed to be getting worse.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On one side of me, the park was dark and silent. Once full of life and laughter, my soul was the same. Play equipment, empty and laced with frost, sat motionless. In the other direction, lights from the town attempted to penetrate the fog. The idea of going home caused a heavy weight to sink in my stomach. I didn&#x2019;t want to face my parents.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or my life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cold seeped through my jeans and coat as I sat down on the hard wooden seat of a nearby swing. Frozen chains creaked softly, and my thoughts took me back to all the times I&#x2019;d played at this park during happy childhood days&#x2014;too many to count. Now I was seventeen; those days were long past.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Why does life have to be so painful?</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned in the swing, twisting the chains above my head tighter and tighter. Then I released. My body unwound in a slow turn. If only the invisible chains wrapped around my heart would free as easily.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A car drove by, and my body tensed. The park closed at dusk. Policemen patrolled the area, and I knew if they found me they&#x2019;d send me home.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>I don&#x2019;t want to go back... I just can&#x2019;t do it.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#x2019;d never hung out in this park at night before. I didn&#x2019;t like being there, but I had no idea where else to go. I just needed time&#x2014;time to figure out what to do next.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My gaze turned to the two sets of railroad tracks at the edge of the park. The first set of tracks was empty. A cluster of six cars sat on the second set. I knew the cops wouldn&#x2019;t be able to see me there.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sluggishly, I made my way over to the line of railroad cars. My eyes zeroed in on the last car. I climbed up the side of it and sat, dangling my legs. I&#x2019;m not sure how much time passed. Maybe an hour, maybe two. The danger of sitting on the train car put me on edge. After all the years living so near the railroad tracks, I&#x2019;d never ventured this close.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I blew warm air into my hands, trying to thaw them, but it did little good.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>What&#x2019;s wrong with me?</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone else seemed to be able to handle the burdens, the struggles of life, better than I could. All I wanted was to be happy. To have the perfect life I always thought I had when I was a kid. But my arms had grown tired from trying to hold my fantasy world together.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lately, it seemed I couldn&#x2019;t do anything right. I wasn&#x2019;t there for my friends and family when they needed me. I was doing horribly in school, and I&#x2019;d become a worry to my family. Now I was &#x201c;grounded until further notice.&#x201d; I pushed the most recent argument with my parents out of my mind. And then there was the pain that ran even deeper than that. Memories too painful to think about. I pushed them back below the surface, as I had for months. In the past year I&#x2019;d started smoking, drinking, and partying with my friends on the weekends, futilely trying to escape the pain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked down at the railroad tracks and remembered a time I&#x2019;d realized the power of a train. <i>A train would kill anyone in an instant. No one could survive that.</i> <i>If I ever wanted to take my life, if ever...that&#x2019;s the way I&#x2019;d do it.<br></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold air around me brought me back to the moment. A deeper chill settled into my bones&#x2014;and my thoughts grew darker; I knew I didn&#x2019;t want anyone to worry about me anymore. More than that, I wanted the<br>pain to stop.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>If I ever want my life to end...this would be my chance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#x2019;s not going to get better. There&#x2019;s no reason I need to be here. There&#x2019;s nothing I&#x2019;m supposed to do here. They&#x2019;d be better off without me.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to think of a reason to stay around, to live, but I could think of only one, my two nephews.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>I&#x2019;m not a very good example anymore. They&#x2019;re probably better off without me anyway, and I don&#x2019;t have any kids of my own. No younger brothers and sisters either. There&#x2019;s nothing important I&#x2019;m supposed to do. My family, my friends...They&#x2019;ll get over me, right? I&#x2019;m just causing pain and problems.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I looked around again at the cold, dark night.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>This night is icky.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is disgusting.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life sucks.</i><br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could all be over soon, and then I won&#x2019;t hurt anymore.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought about school the next day. The homework I hadn&#x2019;t done.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;I&#x2019;m such a failure</i>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Do I want my life to end? If the train comes, should I end it?</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conflicting thoughts ping-ponged, faster, faster.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>It&#x2019;s going to get better.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It isn&#x2019;t going to get better.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#x2019;s a reason I&#x2019;m here.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#x2019;s no reason I&#x2019;m here.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;m supposed to do here.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#x2019;s nothing I&#x2019;m supposed to do here.<br></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was cold, and it was late. I wanted to leave, but I didn&#x2019;t know where to go.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a train whistle split the air. My heart pounded. I hadn&#x2019;t expected the train. Not yet. I still hadn&#x2019;t decided what to do.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew it would be a long time before the next train. <i>This is my chance</i>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thoughts came as fast as the train speeding toward me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;I&#x2019;m so cold. This might be the only train for a while.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I did it, the pain, the heartache, the numbness would be over.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>I&#x2019;m gonna do it. Soon it will </i>all <i>be over.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood between the parked train cars. I glanced across the dip between the tracks I was on and the ones the approaching train was speeding down.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I waited until the train got closer. I didn&#x2019;t want the engineer to see me. I didn&#x2019;t want him to stop the train. The large outline of the train&#x2019;s engine was barely visible beyond the bright headlight. It was almost here.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven waited for me. I was sure of it. I was a good person.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Heaven has to be better than this life.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart pounded as I ran up the small bank. The train&#x2019;s headlight illuminated me. Its horn blared. I tried to push down the fear and shame, turned my face away from the train, and lay facedown.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I clenched my fists, crossed my arms under my head, and braced myself, closing my eyes tight. My head and body lay between the tracks, my legs hung over the rail. I could feel the cold metal against my thighs and the wood and rocks under my stomach. As the train closed in, the ground shook so much that my whole body vibrated. Then the train was upon me, over me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain overwhelmed me. The train roared.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The momentum of the cars pulled at me, as if the train were trying to suck me into itself. The wind tugged harder, wrenching at my jacket and yanking my hair upward. My body rose, lifting slightly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, even more powerful than the wind and the momentum of the train, another force pushed me to the ground. My head and chest hit first, then my hips and legs. Again I felt the power of the train, the shaking of the ground, the roar of it moving over me. The force of the weight pushing me down hurt more than anything else.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear coursed through me. I squeezed my eyes tighter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;It&#x2019;s going to be over now. The pain is going to end. I&#x2019;ll be in heaven soon</i>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the whistle blew again, the vibration of my body stilled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound stopped. The wind stopped. The train stopped.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Am I dead yet?</i><br><br>If you&#x2019;re struggling with suicidal thoughts...<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know how you feel. Life is harder and more painful than you ever thought it could be. You&#x2019;re not sure if it&#x2019;s worth it, but I&#x2019;m telling you there is so much to live for&#x2014;more than you have ever experienced or imagined. Somehow, I hope my story will show that to you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please don&#x2019;t give up. You are not alone. There is a God who made you, and he&#x2019;s not as far away as you may think. He is always near. Wherever you go, whatever you do, he will be with you. He loves you, and he wants to comfort you, heal the hurt in your heart, and carry you through this life. Let him in.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God has an amazing plan for your life, even if you don&#x2019;t have a plan for yourself. He has hope for you, even if you don&#x2019;t have hope for yourself. He loves you immensely, even when you don&#x2019;t love yourself. And he sees beauty in you, even when all you see is a mess.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suicide is never the answer.

In <i>Parables for the Virtual</i> Brian Massumi views the body and media such as television, film, and the Internet, as cultural formations that operate on multiple registers of sensation beyond the reach of the reading techniques founded on the standard rhetorical and semiotic models. <br>Renewing and assessing William James&#x2019;s radical empiricism and Henri <br>Bergson&#x2019;s philosophy of perception through the filter of the post-war French philosophy of Deleuze, Guattari, and Foucault, Massumi links a cultural logic of variation to questions of movement, affect, and sensation. If such concepts are as fundamental as signs and significations, he argues, then a new set of theoretical issues appear, and with them potential new paths for the wedding of scientific and cultural theory. Replacing the traditional opposition of literal and figural with new distinctions between stasis and motion and between actual and virtual, <i>Parables for the Virtual </i>tackles related theoretical issues by applying them to cultural mediums as diverse as architecture, body art, the digital art of Stelarc, and Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s acting career. The result is an intriguing combination of cultural theory, science, and philosophy that asserts itself in a crystalline and multi-faceted argument. <br><i>Parables for the Virtual</i> will interest students and scholars of continental and Anglo-American philosophy, cultural studies, cognitive science, electronic art, digital culture, and chaos theory, as well as those concerned with the &#x201c;science wars&#x201d; and the relation between the humanities and the sciences in general.</p><p>"This is an extraordinary work of scholarship and thought, the most thorough-going critique and reformulation of the culture doctrine that I have read in years. Massumi's prose has a dazzling and sometimes cutting clarity, and yet he bites into very big issues. People will be reading and talking about Parables for the Virtual for a long time to come."&#x2014; Meaghan Morris, author of Too Soon Too Late: History in Popular Culture <p>"Have you been disappointed by books that promise to bring &#x2018;the body&#x2019; or &#x2018;corporeality&#x2019; back into culture? Well, your luck is about to change. In this remarkable book Brian Massumi transports us from the dicey intersection between movement and sensation, through insightful explorations of affect and body image, to a creative reconfiguration of the &#x2018;nature-culture continuum.&#x2019; The writing is experimental and adventurous, as one might expect from a writer who finds inventiveness to be the most distinctive attribute of thinking. The perspective Massumi unfolds will have a major effect on cultural theory for years to come."&#x2014;William Connolly, Johns Hopkins University </p><p>"After Bergson, Whitehead, Deleuze, and Guattari, the great radical empiricist protest against na�ve objectivism and na�ve subjectivism resonates again, bringing wonder back into the most common day experiences. After reading Brian Massumi you will never listen to Sinatra or watch a soccer game the same way again."&#x2014;Isabelle Stengers, Free University of Brussels </p><p>"It is not enough to describe Massumi&#x2019;s book as a brilliant achievement. Seldom do we see a political thinker develop his or her ideas with such scrupulous attention to everyday human existence, creating a marvelously fluid architecture of thought around the fundamental question of what the fact of human embodiment does to the activity of thinking. Massumi&#x2019;s vigorous critique of both social-constructionist and essentialist theorizations of embodied practices renews the Deleuzian tradition of philosophy for our times."&#x2014;Dipesh Chakrabarty, University of Chicago</p>&#34;It is not enough to describe Massumi&#39;s book as a brilliant achievement.

They resemble monumental gateways (or time-tried sentinels) and represent a moment in geologic time when the North American and African continents began to separate and volcanism affected much of Connecticut. The rocks attracted the attention of poets, painters, and naturalists when beliefs rose about the spiritual dimensions of nature in the early 19th century. More than two dozen artists, including Frederick Church, George Durrie, and John Weir, captured their magic and produced an assortment of classic American landscapes. In the same period, the science of geology evolved rapidly, triggered by the controversy between proponents and opponents of biblical explanations for the origin of rocks. Lavishly illustrated, featuring over sixty paintings and prints, this book is a perfect introduction to understanding the relationship of geology and art. It will delight those who appreciate landscape painting, and anyone who has seen the grandeur of East and West Rock.</p><p>JELLE ZEILINGA DE BOER is Harold T.

Tango on film is a chronicle of its own, lurid and strange, mixing dreams and deceptions. Often a tango augments a star&#x2014;Rudolph Valentino, Marlon Brando, Madonna, Al Pacino&#x2014;not for its sake but for theirs. And the accord with the tango is always with stereotype: sadness, sex, violence, and doom.<br><br> This sounds ridiculous and was. But thankfully, in the 1990s, with Adam Boucher&#x2019;s Tango, the Obsession (1998) and Carlos Saura&#x2019;s Tango, no me dejes nunca (Tango, Never Leave Me, 1998), truer versions have appeared on the screen. By then the authenticity of Claudio Segovia and H�ctor Orezzoli&#x2019;s stage extravaganza, Tango Argentino, had cleared the way for genuine footwork, sizzling like a Pollock on the floor.<br><br> The trend toward the real article includes the conversion of a major star of film, Robert Duvall, who makes pilgrimages to Buenos Aires and frequents traditional dance halls. He takes lessons from masters like the late Lampazo, Danel and Maria Bastone of New York, and Juan Carlos Copes, the latter described by Duvall as a &#x201c;Rolls-Royce without a speedometer.&#x201d;<br><br> A Buenos Aires television special cuts to a dance floor where Duvall sits enthralled with his girlfriend, studying the moves. Early in 2000 Duvall danced tango for President Bill Clinton and the president of Argentina in the White House&#x2014;at the express request of the Argentine ambassador.On March 28, 2003, Duvall released his own tango film, Assassination Tango. It had cameo appearances by major tango dancers like Mar�a Nieves, Milena Plebs, Los Hermanos Macana, Pablo Ver�n, and Gerardo Portalea. We&#x2019;ve come a long way from Valentino.<br><br> Valentino was the first man to tango on the screens of North America. His tango in The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921) is a celebrated sequence. Measured against Argentine barrio reality, his moves were a travesty, but his charm and self-confidence made people notice him. Rex Ingram, the director of Horsemen, tells us why:<br><br> I was attracted at once by Valentino&#x2019;s face. It was obvious that he was the exact type for the young tango-hero of the story . . . Rehearsing the tango Rudy did so well I made up my mind to expand this phase of the story. I [used] a sequence in a Universal picture I had made years ago. The sequence showed an adventurous youth going into a Bowery dive and taking the dancer, after he had floored her partner. I transposed this action to South America.<br><br> The account is revealing: Ingram was not interested in tango&#x2014;he just wanted to build up his star.<br><br> Valentino was no stranger to tango. He had danced it at Bustanoby&#x2019;s Domino Room, on 39th and Broadway in Manhattan, around 1913. Mirrors around the room magnified his every action. There he learned the style of the &#x201c;tango pirate&#x201d;&#x2014;ostentatious dipping, holding tight, and above all bending the woman back, way back, building an image of conquest. Valentino was fluent in dips and bends, and that caught the eye of Rex Ingram.<br><br> Four Horsemen was the Titanic of its time. Like the Leonardo DiCaprio film, it had an Italianate lead, and a huge cast and budget. Not since Birth of a Nation (1917) had Hollywood seen anything like it. But the scene the world remembered was Valentino&#x2019;s tango. John Seitz, the cameraman, photographed the action on a set filled with smoke and tough-looking extras, meant to set off the beauty of the stars.<br><br> Valentino appears, you see his face laughing; thin lips, hard eyes, tough jaw. His eyes slit with interest. There is a woman on the dance floor, Beatrice Dom�nguez, dancing with a man. Rising in his incredible<br><br> gaucho/flamenco attire, Valentino ambles over. He asks for a dance. Close-up of Dom�nguez&#x2019;s face: dancing eyes, moist trembling lips. Her partner says no. Valentino sends him flying into a table.<br><br> Then Valentino and Dom�nguez start to dance. Their costumes are so heavy&#x2014;tassels, shawl, dress, carnations, hat, shirt, chaps, whip, boots, spurs&#x2014;that initially their motion reads like a ballet between the Monitor and the Merrimack. Valentino tangos on. Sometimes he holds out a stiff arm in the fashion of the tango of Europe, sometimes not. He looms over Dom�nguez, bending her back, tango-pirate fashion, with a devastating downward gaze. He is making the world look at him. He and Dom�nguez dip and dip again, in a parody of quebradas, Argentine torsions of the hips on bended knees. A black drinks mat� and coldly regards them. They sway. Another black sips a beer. They dip. Close-up: their feet in a crossover, Valentino&#x2019;s spurs flashing.<br><br> His features ride the motion like a mask. He is dancing his face, not the tango. And Dom�nguez dances her lips and her flowers. Before the finale, when their mouths almost meet, the gaucho vaunts his full strength. He picks up Dom�nguez bodily and brings her back down to the floor. The bar erupts. They like that. He does it again. Now everyone&#x2019;s standing and shouting. Cut.<br><br> Valentino conquered the world with that scene. One tango deserved another: he stalked the floor again in Blood and Sand (1922). His faux-tango image would linger in films for some time.<br><br> Argentine dancers are bemused. &#x201c;When we see someone tango, stiff arms and long steps, we laugh and call that dancing � la Valentino,&#x201d; Roberto &#x201c;El Alem�n&#x201d; Tonet, a star of the Broadway stage hit Tango Forever, told me in 1998. Still and all, a distinguished Argentine critic, Sergio Pujol, admits that &#x201c;in spite of the fallacy, Valentino as Buenos Aires type, the success of this dancer-turned-actor is a reality impossible to ignore.&#x201d;<br><br> Gilda (1946), a movie about love and gambling in 1940s Buenos Aires, was Rita Hayworth&#x2019;s greatest role. Somewhere in a casino we hear a bandone�n, but that&#x2019;s about it for the tango. In 1946 barrio dancers were creating new steps, but Gilda gives no hint of this. Buenos Aires is a stage set, midtown Manhattan with signs in Spanish.<br><br> Valentino haunts Billy Wilder&#x2019;s Sunset Boulevard, the classic 1950 film. Gloria Swanson, in the role of a pass� star of silent film, throws a tango party for just herself and William Holden. The scene is handsome: two dancers and a tango orchestra, in rich black and white. It was shot by John Seitz, the cameraman who had filmed Valentino.<br><br> Swanson, keeping Holden under the pretense of hiring him as a writer, hopes to seduce him with the dance music of her era. She will be his Dom�nguez; he will be her Valentino. She hires a tango orchestra to play, endlessly, just for the two of them, in her Beverly Hills mansion on New Year&#x2019;s Eve.<br><br> Holden appears in a tux. The excitement of his looks and the savor of the tango overcome her. She tears off her tiara, like a pirate raising the Jolly Roger, and hurls it to the floor. The camera follows it. Swanson&#x2019;s butler (Eric von Stroheim) retrieves it in white gloves. She rests her head on Holden&#x2019;s shoulder. Getting the point, Holden looks worried.<br><br> Swanson tells Holden, &#x201c;Valentino told me: get rid of my wood floor, replace it with tile.&#x201d; The camera pulls back, revealing a tiled floor in octagonal patterning.<br><br> Holden, the hard-boiled screenwriter, abruptly breaks off and heads for another party, where he knows a young girl awaits him. Swanson, irreparably hurt, retires to her bedroom. She slits both her wrists. End of tango.<br><br> Nearly half a century later Wilder would tell Curtis Hanson, after the latter&#x2019;s triumphant L.A. Confidential, &#x201c;Now I suppose you&#x2019;ll do a comedy.&#x201d; Hanson did: Wonder Boys. Wilder had, too, following Sunset nine years later with the hilarious Some Like It Hot (1959). Tango in this film is pure slapstick: while Tony Curtis romances Marilyn Monroe on a yacht, using an outrageous Gary Grant accent, the camera cross-cuts to Jack Lemmon, tangoing in drag (to hide from gangsters) with Joe E. Brown. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re leading!&#x201d; Brown says.<br><br> Lemmon and Brown lock hands and move forward, heads in profile, in European stiff-arm tango style. They also mirror Valentino, bending each other backward. Brown has a rose in his mouth. By the end of the scene Lemmon is striking insane gypsy poses. The orchestra is blindfolded&#x2014;this spares them the travesty.<br><br> The misuse of tradition intensified in Bernardo Bertolucci&#x2019;s Last Tango in Paris (1972). Forget, if possible, the auteur&#x2019;s ambition to blur art into pornography and vend it as revolution, with a world-class actor, Brando, securing the way. Forget the breakthrough promiscuities that Bertolucci has Brando commit with a smashing ingenue, Maria Schneider. Forget, as well, expectations aroused by the strange, sensual tango danced by Stefania Sandrelli and Dominique Sanda in Bertolucci&#x2019;s earlier film The Conformist (1970). Forget, if you can, all of that and cut to a long, famous scene:<br><br> Interior: bar, dancing; day<br><br> Jeanne is hiding behind dark glasses. Behind them in the room there is a small tango contest. The jury, in front of a long table, follow with their eyes the couples dancing with numbers on their backs.<br><br> paul [brando]: You know the tango is a rite . . . And you must watch the legs of the dancers.<br><br> So far so good. Norman Mailer loved it: &#x201c;[a] near mythical species of tango palace.&#x201d;And the setting is beautiful. Vittorio Storaro&#x2019;s camera distills a golden light in colonnaded spaces, a light that illumines intent, moving couples. Gato Barbieri wrote the score. In sum, we savor a tango nirvana.<br><br> But not for long. Bertolucci was out to use the tango, not to reveal it&#x2014;to use its fame and its glamour, together with Brando&#x2019;s, to power a dark vision.<br><br> He causes the camera to glide like a serpent through the tango contestants, transforming their Eden into hell. Pauline Kael declared the women &#x201c;bitch-chic mannequin-dancers.&#x201d; Somewhere a compliment to their integrity lies buried in that. To Kael the dancers were &#x201c;automatons,&#x201d; posing with &#x201c;wildly fake head-turns.&#x201d;<br><br> Bertolucci&#x2014;and his critics&#x2014;had misunderstood tango hauteur, which, as the gifted Julie Taylor reminds us, consists of the following: &#x201c;dancers demonstrate their skill by perform[ing] like somber automatons, providing [themselves with] psychic space.&#x201d; The root of all this is black cool. But by 1972 the Afro-Argentine shaping of the frozen face in tango had long since been forgotten, even among most tangueros.<br><br> Bertolucci, in any event, definitely reduced dancers to mannikins. He turned ritual into farce. It gets worse:<br><br> president of the tango jury: Now gentlemen, ladies, all best wishes for the last tango!<br><br> Note the last phrase. For some this suggested the end of the tango as a world-class tradition. As if to rub that interpretation in, Brando drunkenly sashays his way across the dance hall, mocking the seriousness of the contestants, mocking their moves, mocking their reason for being. He makes fun of their posture. He falls flat on his back, like a spread-eagled ape.<br><br> Then Schneider tells Brando she&#x2019;s leaving him. He chases her, corners her. She pulls out a pistol. She kills him. End of tango.<br><br> Critics rose to Bertolucci&#x2019;s faux-revolutionary bait. Pauline Kael pronounced Last Tango equal to Stravinsky&#x2019;s Rite of Spring&#x2014;not the best call for someone whose judgments were normally brilliant. Another critic went so far as to denounce the tango judge, as if she were personally responsible for the Vietnam War. It was dangerous to be decent in the 1970s.<br><br> Norman Mailer, alone among critics, felt uneasy: &#x201c;Did [Brando&#x2019;s] defacement of the tango,&#x201d; he asked, &#x201c;injure some final nerve of . . . deportment.&#x201d;<br><br> It did. The damage was not virtual&#x2014;it was real. Copes remembers, &#x201c;Last Tango was the climax of films that ridiculed tango.&#x201d; People the world over got the impression in the 1970s that tango was &#x201c;antiquated and comic.&#x201d; Recalling Wittgenstein&#x2019;s famous axiom &#x201c;The meaning of a symbol is its use,&#x201d; tango had been defined, unfairly, by mis-use.<br><br> The Argentine military government of 1972 banned Last Tango, so Buenos Aires was prevented from making up its own mind at the time. The grim political reality of the proceso, the dictatorship of the military junta that ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983, in many respects put tango&#x2014;and tango criticism&#x2014;on ice.<br><br> But things started changing in Europe in 1977. That was the year of Soldier of Orange (Soldaat van Oranje), directed by Paul Verhoeven, one of the best European films of the century. It includes a strong tango, bristling with politics.<br><br> This tango was an invention. It does not exist in the memoir of the Dutch hero of the Resistance upon whose life the film is based. As Verhoeven recalls, &#x201c;We were looking for a situation to bring the hero and the anti-hero of the film together and came up with the tango.&#x201d; One model for their dance was Lemmon&#x2019;s tango with Brown in Some Like It Hot.<br><br> &#x201c;I grew up admiring that scene,&#x201d; recalls Verhoeven. The other source was Bertolucci, &#x201c;but only as a second impression.&#x201d; Verhoeven, in any event, transcended his sources.<br><br> Soldaat is the tale of two Dutchmen. Tight friends in school, they separate after the occupation of the Netherlands by Nazi forces in May 1940. One, played by Rutger Hauer, escapes to Great Britain, then returns by submarine in 1943 to spy for the Allies. The other, played by Derek de Lint, joins the German army and becomes an SS officer. (He is eventually shipped to the eastern front, where Soviet partisans assassinate him.)<br><br> De Lint and Hauer meet at a party in occupied Holland. The scene is a hotel in Noordwijk, a small beach town not far from The Hague. The time is early 1943. There is a swastika on the wall. The room is filled with Nazis. De Lint, as if to extend the aura of Hitler&#x2019;s aggression, suddenly seizes Hauer. He makes him tango with him.<br><br> Their dance is war. It returns us, in an odd way, to early days in Buenos Aires, when men tangoed with men, to practice for women. De Lint and Hauer break, however, a fundamental rule of tango dancers: they talk.<br><br> alex [de lint]: Quite a disappointment to see you here among these Dutch Nazis and builders of Hitler&#x2019;s bunkers on the coast.<br><br> erik [hauer]: Why not? It&#x2019;s war, and it&#x2019;s a nice party, isn&#x2019;t it?<br><br> alex: I heard you were abroad.<br><br> erik: That&#x2019;s bullshit!<br><br> alex: I heard you were in London.<br><br> erik: You heard wrong. I&#x2019;m here.<br><br> alex: Shame we&#x2019;re not fighting on the same side.<br><br> erik: Yeah . . . a bloody shame.<br><br> alex: In a couple of years the Germans and English will be fighting together against the Communists.<br><br> erik: I don&#x2019;t believe that.<br><br> alex: Well, anyway, we won&#x2019;t be around to see it.<br><br> Hidden in this dialogue is an odd prediction of the coming of the cold war. It is clear de Lint is not fooled by Hauer&#x2019;s cover. One senses, correctly, that out of loyalty he will not betray him. So their dance is a mix of friendship and politics, fascism and democracy.<br><br> Suddenly the two men break into mirrored head-turns. It puts them in joking relation to their audience&#x2014;and to tango film history. They&#x2019;re citing Some Like It Hot with a dash of Last Tango, pure movie faux-tango cool. Hauer and de Lint perform appropriately stone-faced. They are having fun. Beaming, pretty women form a circle around them, giving them space and approval.<br><br> They race up and...</p><h2>Champagne: A Global History (Edible)</h2><p><p></p>From the smash of a bottle on the side of a new ship to the pop of the cork at a New Year&#x2019;s Eve party champagne signals celebration, fun, and camaraderie all over the world.

She finds in those intersections the basis for understanding why women were accused of witchcraft more often than men, why they confessed more often, and why they frequently accused other women of being witches. In negotiating their beliefs about the devil's powers, both women and men embedded womanhood in the discourse of depravity.<br>Puritan ministers insisted that women and men were equal in the sight of God, with both sexes equally capable of cleaving to Christ or to the devil. Nevertheless, Reis explains, womanhood and evil were inextricably linked in the minds and hearts of seventeenth-century New England Puritans. Women and men feared hell equally but Puritan culture encouraged women to believe it was their vile natures that would take them there rather than the particular sins they might have committed.<br>Following the Salem witchcraft trials, Reis argues, Puritans' understanding of sin and the devil changed. Ministers and laity conceived of a Satan who tempted sinners and presided physically over hell, rather than one who possessed souls in the living world. Women and men became increasingly confident of their redemption, although women more than men continued to imagine themselves as essentially corrupt, even after the Great Awakening.</p></p><p><p>ELIZABETH REIS is Assistant Professor of Women's and Gender Studies at the University of Oregon. She is the editor of Spellbound: Women and Witchcraft in America, American Sexual Histories, and Dear Lizzie.</p><p>"A reader unfamiliar with Puritan doctrine or its subtle deviation from Calvinism will quickly become informed. All key terms are clearly defined in context, and the book is heavily footnoted with early and modern sources. Most striking are the confessions by the unfortunate accused."</p><br><br><p>"Reis makes a complex and persuasive argument that men and women defined their relationship to sin in different ways.... Reis has offered a richly textured and deeply informed study.... This is an important and valuable book, one that broadens our understanding of a variety of issues, particularly those related to matters of gender. Reis has presented a major contribution to the scholarship of seventeenth-century New England which also opens avenues for investigation that go beyond her splendid treatment of the 'witchcraft' issue."</p> (Bernard Rosenthal, The New England Quarterly)<br><br><p>"In this interesting book, Elizabeth Reis argues that ordinary Puritans were as much concerned about damnation as they were about sanctification.... In its attention to popular ideas about supernatural reality and their role in constructing gender, this book is an important contribution to our understanding of American religious thought&#x2015;and a timely one, given the resurgence of supernatural beliefs today. Moreover, Reis's emphasis on the power of religious belief is enlightening, as is her skillful return to Puritan culture as a basis for understanding the historical development of American religious thought."</p> (Amanda Porterfield, Catholic Historical Review)<br><br><p>"In this thoughtful and stimulating book, Reis has reintroduced religion and the Devil into the discussion of 17th-century New England witchcraft, reminding readers that despite factors such as psychology, property, class distinctions, economic differences, and geography, New Englanders understood witchcraft to be a contest between God and the Devil.... Reis argues that men saw their sin as specific ungodly actions, easily overcome, while women interpreted their sin as inherent in their very natures, far less easily resisted.... She concludes that the Salem episode change society's view of the Devil, in that the 18th century came to view the Devil less as a physical presence and more as a spiritual tempter, much easier to resist. Strongly recommended."</p><br><br><p>"When trying to explain the timing and course of events at Salem, historians almost never turned to the assumptions about gender&#x2015;maleness and femaleness&#x2015;embedded within a Puritan cosmology. Elizabeth Reis' rich-minded (and delightfully titled) Damned Women takes great strides toward addressing these omissions.... Reis shifts the inquiry away from the attributes and interests of individuals, toward radical Protestantism, gender ideologies and male-female internalization of these powerful intellectual systems. She seeks to understand, first, how gender systems cut across religious belief, both during and after the trails; in the process, she is able to draw the history of witchcraft trials into the intellectual history of Puritanism."</p><br><br><p>"An impressive book from which I learned a great deal."</p> (John M. Murrin, Princeton University)</p><h2>Alfred Ollivant&#39;s Bob, Son of Battle: The Last Gray Dog of Kenmuir (New York Review Children&#39;s Collection)</h2><p>Bob, Son of Battle, is a sheepdog so canny and careful of his flock, so deeply devoted to his master, James Moore, and so admired for his poise and wisdom by the residents of a small village in the rugged mountains of England&#x2019;s North Country, that young though he is, he is already known as Owd Bob. In a recent contest, Bob has proved himself a matchless sheepdog, and if he wins the trophy two more times, he&#x2019;ll be seen as equal to the legendary sheepdogs of yore.&nbsp;<br><br> But Bob has a real rival: Red Wull, with his docked tail and bristling yellow fur, a ferocious creature, just like his diminutive master, Adam McAdam, a lonely Scot, estranged not only from his English neighbors but from his son, David. McAdam just can&#x2019;t stop belittling this strapping young man, all the more so since David began courting Moore&#x2019;s beautiful daughter Maggie. But what McAdam really wants is for his beloved Wullie to wrest the prize from Bob once and for all.&nbsp;<br><br> The story takes a darker turn when a troubling new threat to the local flocks emerges. A dog has gone rogue, sneaking out at night to feast on the flesh and blood of the sheep he is bound to protect. Again and again, new sheep fall prey to this relentless predator; again and again, he slips away undetected. This master hunter can only be among the boldest and sharpest of dogs . . .<br> <i>Bob, Son of Battle</i> has long been a beloved classic of children&#x2019;s literature both in America and in England. Here the celebrated author and translator Lydia Davis, who first read and loved this exciting story as a child, has rendered the challenging idioms of the original into fluent and graceful English of our day, making this tale of rival dogs and rival families and the shadowy terrain between Good and Bad accessible and appealing to readers of all ages.</p><p><b>Alfred Ollivant (1874&#x2013;1927) </b>was born in Old Charlton, Kent, the son of a colonel in the Royal Horse Artillery. Shortly after he graduated from the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, intending to pursue a career in the army, he was thrown from his horse and seriously injured. While beginning his recuperation from the accident (he was to remain under his doctors&#x2019; care for the next fourteen years), he wrote <i>Owd</i> <i>Bob: The Grey Dog of Kenmuir</i> (known in the United States as <i>Bob, Son of Battle</i>), which was a best seller both in the United Kingdom and the United States when it came out in 1898. Ollivant would go on to publish fourteen more novels, as well as various occasional essays, poems, and other works, including, during the First World War, a series of articles describing wartime life in England for an American audience.<br><b> Marguerite Kirmse (1885&#x2013;1954) </b>was born in Bournesmouth, England. She emigrated to the United States as an accomplished harpist in order to continue her musical education, but instead embarked on a highly successful career as an illustrator. She is best known for her drawings of dogs, including those in <i>Lassie, Come-Home</i> by Eric Knight.<br><b> Lydia Davis </b>is the author of seven collections of stories, including <i>Break It Down</i>, <i>Samuel Johnson Is Indignant</i>, and, most recently, <i>Can&#x2019;t and Won&#x2019;t</i>, as well as one novel, <i>The End of the Story</i>. Her <i>Collected Stories </i>were published as a single volume in 2009, and in 2013 she was awarded an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award of Merit Medal for the Short Story, as well as the Man Booker International Prize. She is also the translator of many books from the French, most notably Proust&#x2019;s <i>Swann&#x2019;s Way</i> and Flaubert&#x2019;s <i>Madame Bovary</i>.Gr 3&#x2013;6&#x2014;What's a childhood without dog stories, such as Lassie, Old Yeller, and Shiloh? With this new version of Ollivant's Owd Bob: The Grey Dog of Kenmuir, Davis ensures that Bob, son of Battle, is a name to be added to that list. First published in 1889, Ollivant's work follows two sheepdogs and their masters: prickly Adam McAdam and his brutish dog, Red Wull, who herds by force; and kindly James Moore, whose equally skilled but more gallant Bob keeps order through an intuitive understanding of sheep. These two arch rivals are about to go head to head in a contest that will prove which is the superior sheepdog. Adding to the drama, Adam's son, David, who recently lost his mother, attempts to court James's daughter, while by night, sheep are menaced by what appears to be a rogue sheepdog. Though this reissue keeps the original art by Marguerite Kirmse (best known for illustrating Eric Knight's Lassie, Come-Home), Davis translates the Cumbrian and Scottish dialect of the original into modern English, ensuring that this classic canine tale will once more find a home among readers.</p><h2>In Putin&#39;s Footsteps: Searching for the Soul of an Empire Across Russia&#39;s Eleven Time Zones</h2><p><p><b><i>In Putin&#x2019;s Footsteps</i> is Nina Khrushcheva and Jeffrey Tayler&#x2019;s unique combination of travelogue, current affairs, and history, showing how Russia&#x2019;s dimensions have shaped its identity and culture through the decades.</b></p><p>With exclusive insider status as Nikita Khrushchev&#x2019;s great grand-daughter, and an ex-pat living and reporting on Russia and the Soviet Union since 1993, Nina Khrushcheva and Jeffrey Tayler offer a poignant exploration of the largest country on earth through their recreation of Vladimir Putin&#x2019;s fabled New Year&#x2019;s Eve speech planned across all eleven time zones.</p><p>After taking over from Yeltsin in 1999, and then being elected president in a landslide, Putin traveled to almost two dozen countries and a quarter of Russia&#x2019;s eighty-nine regions to connect with ordinary Russians.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy.

To understand Greenspan's story is to see the economic and political landscape of the last 30 years--and the presidency from Reagan to George W. Bush--in a whole new light. As the most influential economic statesman of his age, Greenspan spent a lifetime grappling with a momentous shift: the transformation of finance from the fixed and regulated system of the post-war era to the free-for-all of the past quarter century. The story of Greenspan is also the story of the making of modern finance, for good and for ill.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Greenspan's life is a quintessential American success story: raised by a single mother in the Jewish �migr� community of Washington Heights, he was a math prodigy who found a niche as a stats-crunching consultant. A master at explaining the economic weather to captains of industry, he translated that skill into advising Richard Nixon in his 1968 campaign. This led to a perch on the White House Council of Economic Advisers, and then to a dazzling array of business and government roles, from which the path to the Fed was relatively clear. A fire-breathing libertarian and disciple of Ayn Rand in his youth who once called the Fed's creation a historic mistake, Mallaby shows how Greenspan reinvented himself as a pragmatist once in power. In his analysis, and in his core mission of keeping inflation in check, he was a maestro indeed, and hailed as such. At his retirement in 2006, he was lauded as the age's necessary man, the veritable God in the machine, the global economy's avatar. His memoirs sold for record sums to publishers around the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> But then came 2008. Mallaby's story lands with both feet on the great crash which did so much to damage Alan Greenspan's reputation. Mallaby argues that the conventional wisdom is off base: Greenspan wasn't a na�ve ideologue who believed greater regulation was unnecessary. He had pressed for greater regulation of some key areas of finance over the years, and had gotten nowhere. To argue that he didn't know the risks in irrational markets is to miss the point. He knew more than almost anyone; the question is why he didn't act, and whether anyone else could or would have. A close reading of Greenspan's life provides fascinating answers to these questions, answers whose lessons we would do well to heed. Because perhaps Mallaby's greatest lesson is that economic statesmanship, like political statesmanship, is the art of the possible. <i>The Man Who Knew</i> is a searching reckoning with what exactly comprised the art, and the possible, in the career of Alan Greenspan.</p><p><b>Sebastian Mallaby</b> is the author of several books, including the bestselling <i>More Money Than God</i>.

Volcker Senior Fellow for International Economics at the Council on Foreign Relations.One<br><br>The Feeling of a Conqueror<br><br>Growing up in the 1930s, he fell in love with the railroads. The great locomotives, puffing and panting as they hauled their unimaginable loads, seemed less like machines than mythical creatures-"some species of mastodon," as a book of the time put it.To watch the beam of light from the great monster's headlamps, to glimpse the hellish fire lighting the interior of the cab, to see the shadow of the fireman silhouetted against the glow-all this was to experience the thrill and terror of industry and progress, to see precisely what was meant by the American century. From around the age of eleven, the young Alan collected train timetables, memorized the routes and the towns along the way, and imagined himself traveling the continent: Duluth to Minneapolis, Minneapolis to Fargo, and then onward and westward to Helena, Spokane, and finally Seattle. It was a way of conjuring a world beyond Washington Heights, the neighborhood of immigrants he inhabited on the northern tongue of Manhattan; a way of escaping the squat redbrick apartment building with its ornate stucco moldings, of freeing his mind from the too-familiar streets filled with European accents-Yiddish, Irish, and German. Washington Heights had been developed just a few years earlier, after the New York subway stretched north to reach it in 1906. But although the subway had arrived, you could still see horses on the streets and men who cleaned up after them. No wonder the railroads seemed romantic.<br><br>Alan lived with his grandparents Nathan and Anna Goldsmith and with his doting mother, Rose. They shared a one-bedroom apartment at 600 West 163rd Street; Nathan and Anna had the bedroom, while Alan and Rose slept in what had been built as the dining room. It was a modest accommodation for four people, but it seemed a reasonable lot-better than the crowded tenements of the Lower East Side, where other immigrants lived, and not bad given that the country was in the grip of the Depression. The Goldsmiths lived on the west side of Broadway, the dividing line that separated the salubrious part of the neighborhood from the rough-and-tumble east. "The . . . gentility of the neighborhood . . . along with the style of the buildings, the parks nearby, and the cool breeze from the Hudson in the evening carried vague reminders of the bourgeois sections of German cities," a contemporary wrote. German immigrants flocked to Washington Heights in such numbers that the area was sometimes known as Frankfurt on the Hudson.<br><br>To Nathan and Anna, born in Russia, driven to migrate to Hungary and then from Hungary to America, life in New York must have seemed a blessing almost divine-they had boarded their grandson's imaginary train, and after much adventure had arrived safely. As for Rose, born in Hungary though now as American as baseball, there was much to celebrate, too. She had a steady job as a salesperson at the Ludwig-Baumann furniture store in the Bronx, which paid enough to meet the rent of $48 each month, keep food on the table, and even spare Alan a quarter a week for pocket money. Besides, she was happy to be living just half a block away from her sister, the well-to-do Mary. In summer Alan would stay with Mary at her vacation house close to Rockaway Beach, on the near end of Long Island. Alan and his cousin Wesley would spend hours walking the sands with their heads down, searching doggedly for lost coins. Then they would spend the fruits of their labor on candy.<br><br>Rose's greatest blessing was young Alan himself, born on March 6, 1926, the product of her brief marriage to Herbert Greenspan. The boy naturally expanded to fill the gaps in Rose's life-the husband who had left when their son was still small, the absence of other children. Each morning her young hero with his perfectly even features and broad smile would soldier off to the P.S. 169 elementary school on Audubon Avenue, and each afternoon he would return with extraordinary things. From very early on, he could add large numbers in his head, and seemed even to enjoy it. Rose trotted him out in front of aunts and uncles to perform. "Alan, what's thirty-five plus ninety-two?" she would ask. "A hundred and twenty-seven," came back the answer.<br><br>A few years after he turned addition into a performance art, Alan developed a passion for baseball, and it was hard to say what thrilled him more: the excitement of listening to the radio commentary of the 1936 World Series or the discovery of a world that could be reduced to the statistics and symbols of a prodigious ten-year-old's devising. The statistics were straightforward, but pleasing all the same: a player who got a hit on three out of eleven appearances had a batting average of .273; one who succeeded five out of thirteen times had an average of .385; it was thanks to baseball that Alan memorized the conversion tables for fractions into decimals. But the symbols were where the creativity came in. Alan invented a notation that allowed him to track each play of the big games. If a player hit a ground ball, he would inscribe a careful x on his green scoring sheet. If the player hit a line drive, he would enter an ellipse; a circle with an x through it meant a high fly, and an alpha meant a deep hit into the outfield. Each fielder's position was assigned a number that could be combined with the symbols to create a precise record of the play: for example, an ellipse next to an 11 meant a line drive to right center field. Reflecting on his childhood some seventy-five years later, Alan remained convinced that his system was better than anything that even the newspaper writers had invented. Rose, no doubt, had agreed with him.<br><br>Alan was too young to remember his father's departure, but the separation affected him deeply. To be a single child can be character forming. To be the single child of a single mother can be overwhelming. It has been said that Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the statesman who loomed over the America of Alan's youth, drew his confidence and ambition from his widowed mother's unrelenting attention: he was the work of her life, her monument.Fortunately for Alan, his mother was far less controlling than the imposing Sara Roosevelt, who thought nothing of installing her married son in a town house adjoining hers, then cutting a door from her large bedroom through her daughter-in-law's much smaller one in order to gain access to Franklin's quarters. But though Rose was mild by comparison, her son was nonetheless the sole outlet for her love, and it seems likely that his sense of what he might achieve expanded correspondingly. "A man who has been the indisputable favorite of his mother keeps for life the feeling of a conqueror, that confidence of success that often induces real success," Sigmund Freud declared, possibly with more intuition than evidence. At a minimum, Alan was prepared to believe that he could beat baseball writers at their own game, and that one day he might ride a train as far as the Pacific.<br><br>Yet if Alan felt confident in his intellectual abilities, he was less comfortable with people. He could master baseball through force of intellect; human chemistry was different. Part of his self-doubt may have come from his mother, for Rose was a hard act to follow. Pretty, vivacious, and gregarious, she could easily have made any child feel tongue-tied by comparison. At family gatherings, Alan's uncle Murray, who now went by the name of Mario and tried to pass as Italian, would play the piano with great flair; he had achieved success as a writer of musicals in Hollywood. But it was Rose who provided the accompaniment, a repertoire of period songs performed in the loose and haunting manner of a torch singer. Leaning over the baby grand piano in the living room of their apartment, flashing her infectious smile, Rose could make herself the center of the party. Alan would be left feeling that he was somehow off toward the side-a "sideman," he would call himself.<br><br>But the most obvious explanation for the young Alan's diffidence lay with his father. Herbert Greenspan had arrived in the United States as the four-year-old Haim Grunspann, a lowly "steerage alien" aboard a ship that docked in Ellis Island in August 1906. Like Rose, he was good-looking, with the aquiline nose and fine cheekbones of the film star Gene Kelly. But while Rose was unfailingly sunny, Herbert could be awkward and withdrawn, and he may have passed down to Alan a tendency to live inside his own head. The fact of Herbert's absence reinforced that tendency greatly. After the divorce, Herbert moved back in with his family in Brooklyn, barely twenty miles away. But though he would promise to take Alan on outings, he often failed to keep his word."Alan hardly got to see him. But I do remember the ecstasy that Alan exhibited on those rare occasions when his father visited," his cousin Wesley remembered.The experience of being let down by his father taught Alan that depending on the love of others could be a path to pain. It seemed safer to retreat into his own mind, to the controlled world of baseball statistics and railroad timetables.<br><br>As a very young child, Alan expressed his longing for a father directly. His stern grandfather was no substitute-Nathan spoke in a forbidding Yiddish accent and was consumed by the world of his synagogue, which Alan found so alien that he later came close to refusing the bar mitzvah.But Alan's uncle Irwin, the father of Wesley, was a more approachable figure.Sometimes Irwin would set out for a walk holding Wesley with one hand and Wesley's younger sister with the other, with Alan tagging alongside. Pretty soon Alan would worm his way between uncle and cousin until his hand was being held, and Wesley was left to keep up independently. But as Alan grew older, these transparent pleas for love were less frequent; he dealt with the gap left by his father by withdrawing into himself, and found that spending time alone made him feel comfortable and happy.Even his school friends could see that he was unusually self-contained. Irwin Kantor, Alan's closest companion at the Edward W. Stitt Junior High School on 164th Street, spent hours at his apartment, absorbed in a game the two boys invented, a form of baseball with dice. Years later, Irwin remembered Alan as a strange loner-no siblings, no father, a mother who was out at work, and grandparents who seemed stuck in an old world in which children spoke only when spoken to.<br><br>"I think he really grew up with the radio, with his own thoughts," Greenspan's wife, Andrea Mitchell, would say later. "I don't know if it made him sad and lonely, but it certainly shaped the person he is. He's not easily accessible to people and he's very shy.<br><br>"Very shy," she added.<br><br>If Alan�s circumstances fed his natural introspection, they also nourished his ambition. A powerful voice inside him whispered that he was capable of greatness-his facility with numbers showed that this was so, and his mother�s adoration removed all doubt of it. Yet he also understood that the world would never recognize his greatness unless he demonstrated it beyond doubt, for he lacked the levity and carefree charm necessary to attain status without effort. If he was ever going to be someone, he would have to work hard. By doing things, achieving things, the sideman would be noticed.<br><br>His father had a clear idea of how Alan's ambition might be directed. In 1935, Herbert published a tract called Recovery Ahead!, a paean to the New Deal that likened Roosevelt to a grand general leading the country to the "Delectable Mountains of prosperity." Herbert's motives for writing were commercial, not literary or scholarly; an ad for the book in the New York Times promised "a chart in which the writer predicts the month by month fluctuations of the stock market during 1935 and 1936."Unembarrassed by this startling claim of foresight, Herbert presented a copy of Recovery to his son, with an inscription hoping that the nine-year-old would take an interest in economics. "At your maturity you may look back and endeavor to interpret the reasoning behind these logical forecasts and begin a like work of your own," Herbert wrote. But although his son would ultimately follow his suggested path, the advice meant nothing at the time. Alan read a few pages of the book and then gave up. It was too much for a nine-year-old.<br><br>Pushing the New Deal to one side, Alan focused his ambitions on baseball-as well as analyzing the game, he played it. As he entered his teens, he developed an athletic frame, and his agility and reflexes gave him what the sport demanded. He was a left-hander, which made him a natural first baseman; playing in a local park with older kids one day, he hit a curveball so confidently that an impressed high schooler declared he was headed for the major leagues. The compliment filled Alan with a powerful pride. He would go to Yankee Stadium and gaze down at his heroes: Lou Gehrig on first, Joe DiMaggio in the outfield, Lefty Gomez or Red Ruffing pitching-seventy years later, he could still recite the lineup from memory. And as he watched those champions playing, he sometimes imagined a fantastic reversal of his role. One day, instead of looking down at that exquisite diamond, he might be down there himself. Instead of gazing, he would be gazed upon. He would take his position at the center of the universe.He would be a major league first baseman.<br><br>Alan completed junior high school in 1939, having skipped one year on the advice of his teachers. His next port of call was George Washington High School, a formidable structure with Italianate columns perched on a hilly promontory overlooking the Harlem River; the dramatic setting reinforced the building's mass and height, as if it were some temple lifted from antiquity. The school was among the best in the city: it boasted excellent teachers, and it served a neighborhood of ambitious immigrants determined to succeed in their new land by excelling in the classroom.Alan continued to play baseball in high school, no doubt replaying that scene of himself at Yankee Stadium inside his head. But the truth was that his athletic progress began to taper off, and gradually he came to realize that his ambition needed a new outlet. This time he found it in music.<br><br>Alan's focus on music confirmed his mother's influence-and his father's lack of it. As well as presenting the boy with his book on economics, Herbert had taken him to visit an uncle, an accountant who lived in enviable splendor in an apartment on Central Park South; given Alan's aptitude for math, he might have decided in his teens to adopt this uncle as a role model. But nothing about the father appealed much to the son; he was far more drawn to his maternal family. Grandfather Nathan was a cantor in a synagogue in the Bronx; Uncle Mario could play the most complex piano pieces on sight; Cousin Claire was on her way to becoming a professional singer. And, of course, music was Rose's love. The sound of a Bach concerto or a music-hall ballad transported Alan to a happy place, where his mother was singing and the rhythm and melody bound the two of them together.</p><h2>The Hearts of Men: American Dreams and the Flight from Commitment</h2><p>From the bestselling author of <b>Nickel and Dimed,</b> an explanation of recent sexual culture and the loosening of marriage bonds in recent history. <br><br> "Finally someone is offering a new, utterly plausible explanation...of loosening marriage bonds.

At first, the self-declared Great Leader seems merely a harmless oddball, but as Sunderson and his unlikely sixteen-year-old sidekick dig deeper, they find him more intelligent and sinister than they realized. Recently divorced and frequently pickled in alcohol, Sunderson tracks his quarry from the woods of Michigan to a town in Arizona, filled with professional and criminal border-crossers, and on to Nebraska where the Great Leader&#x2019;s most recent recruits have gathered to glorify his questionable religion. But Sunderson&#x2019;s demons are also in pursuit of him.<br><br>Rich with character, unexpected twists, and Harrison&#x2019;s trademark wry wit, <i>The Great Leader</i> is at once a gripping American odyssey and the poignant story of a man grappling with age, lost love, and his own darker nature.<br></p><p>JIM HARRISON is the author of over thirty-one books of poetry, nonfiction, and fiction, including <i>Legends of the Fall, The Road Home, The English Major, and The Farmer's Daughter</i>.

During the 1950s and &#x2019;60s, her piercing blue eyes, strawberry blonde hair, and shapely figure were used to sell the world an image of cool sexuality.<br><br>The contrast between image and reality, the public and the private, is at the heart of Julie London&#x2019;s story. Through years of research; extensive interviews with family, friends, and musical associates; and access to rarely seen or heard archival material, author Michael Owen reveals the impact of her image on the direction of her career and how it influenced the choices she made, including the ultimate decision to walk away from performing.<br><br><i>Go Slow</i> follows Julie London&#x2019;s life and career through its many stages: her transformation from 1940s movie starlet to coolly defiant singer of the classic torch ballad &#x201c;Cry Me a River&#x201d; of the &#x2019;50s, and her journey from Las Vegas hotel entertainer during the rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll revolution of the &#x2019;60s to the no-nonsense nurse of the &#x2019;70s hit television series&nbsp;<i>Emergency!</i><br></p><p><b>Michael Owen</b> is a writer, archivist, and researcher.

The author provides lots of new information and historical context, while, to his credit, resisting the temptation to make outrageous claims for his subject. I learned a lot that I didn&#x2019;t know and it made me want to hear more.&#x201d; &#x2014;Will Friedwald, author of <i>Stardust Melodies </i>and <i>Sinatra! The Song Is You</i><br><br><br>&#x201c;Michael Owen tells the unique story of a singular talent and reluctant celebrity with dispassionate appreciation, weaving personal life and professional history into the tale of a woman who was steadfast in her personal passions and career path without the ego and ambition that drives so many other singers and actors. Neither sycophant nor assassin, Owen deftly chronicles Julie London&#x2019;s life with both empathy and objectivity.&#x201d; &#x2014;Michael Cuscuna, record producer, writer, and discographer<br><br><br>&#x201c;Owen's fascinating, clear-eyed portrait examines her work and looks at her decision to walk away from show business in the &#x2018;70s, as well as her apparent indifference to her career.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Arizona Republic</i><br><br><br>&#x201c;Michael Owen has written an interesting book that fans of London or people interested in the popular culture of the 1950s will want to read.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>All About Jazz</i><br><br><br>&#x201c;This biography is an overdue appreciation of a chanteuse capable of squeezing every bit of meaning and emotion out of ballads. . .&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i><br><br><br>&#x201c;Now, thanks to Michael Owen&#x2019;s well-researched and explorative biography, we begin to see what a skilled, multi-talented entertainer Julie London was. . .&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Jazz Profiles</i><br><br>&#x201c;An affectionate and complex portrait of London that will help rekindle an interest in her life and work.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Go Slow</i> is a sensitive, informative biography, inviting the reader to discover Julie London&#x2019;s unique and solitary contribution to the history of American music. With an ear for tone and an eye for story, Michael Owen leads us seamlessly through a life fashioned for style, revealing an instinctive range where just enough sound can occupy a space, exploiting every lyrical nuance along the way. As <i>Go Slow</i> discloses, through years of struggle and turmoil, an irony was born that would further distill some of Julie&#x2019;s finest work as an interpreter of popular song. Esteemed jazz vocalists and musicians loved and respected her. A generous spirit to her family and friends, Julie London was one grand dame and there will never be anyone like her.

The Modern Library relaunches the series with the first of its specialized collections -- interviews with sixteen women novelists, poets, and playwrights, all offering rich commentary on the art of writing and on the opportunities and challenges a woman writer faces in contemporary society.</p><p>"What is it about interviews that attracts us?" Margaret Atwood asks in her introduction to this collection of 16 interviews from <i>The Paris Review</i>. "Specifically, what is it about interviews with writers?" <i>Women Writers at Work</i> may not answer that question, but it raises many, many more--and allows the writers included in this volume to speak for themselves. For decades the <i>Paris Review</i> has been interviewing authors of both genders and every literary stripe, and many of these interviews have been collected together in volumes like this one. This, however, is the first time the Writers at Work series has dedicated itself to one gender only. In this volume readers will find insightful interviews with Marianne Moore, Katherine Anne Porter, Rebecca West, Dorothy Parker, P.L. Travers, Simone de Beauvoir, Eudora Welty, Elizabeth Bishop, Mary McCarthy, Nadine Gordimer, Maya Angelou, Anne Sexton, Toni Morrison, Susan Sontag, Joan Didion and Joyce Carol Oates. <p> The <i>Paris Review</i> is famous for getting authors to open up. The subjects here offer honest, often provocative opinions about themselves (Dorothy Parker on her humorous verses: "I read my verses now and I ain't funny. I haven't been funny for twenty years"); each other (Mary McCarthy on "women writers": "Katherine Anne Porter? Don't think she really is--I mean her writing is certainly very feminine, but I would say that there wasn't the 'WW' business in Katherine Anne Porter"); and writing itself (Toni Morrison: "What makes me feel I belong here, out in this world, is not the teacher, not the mother, not the lover but what goes on in my mind when I'm writing"). The end result is a fascinating glimpse into these writers' minds and works. <i>--Margaret Prior</i></p>"The editors and interviewers of the Writers at Work series have become curators of live genius, marvelous literary taxidermists who have discovered a way to mount the great minds of their day without the usual killing and stuffing, to preserve them for all time. Surely this is now one of the single most persistent acts of cultural conservation in the history of the world, and one of our great national resources."-- Joe David Bellamy, Writing at the End of the Millennium<p>"Aspiring writers should read the entire canon of literature that precedes them, back to the Greeks, up to the current issue of The Paris Review."-- William Kennedy</p><p>"It is a safe bet that thirty and even three hundred years from now these conversations will be invaluable to students of twentieth-century literature."-- Time</p></p><h2>Pearl Harbor (American Girl: Real Stories From My Time) (4)</h2><p>Discover the stories of the real people and events that shaped American history in the Real Stories From My Time series.

Seldom has a book spoken so dramatically to another writer. Many commentators even believe that Humboldt's discussion of issues of freedom and individual responsibility possesses greater clarity and directness than Mill's.</p><p> </p><p><b><i>The Limits of State Action,</i></b> by "Germany's greatest philosopher of freedom," as F. A. Hayek called him, has an exuberance and attention to principle that make it a valuable introduction to classical liberal political thought. It is also crucial for an understanding of liberalism as it developed in Europe at the turn of the nineteenth century. Humboldt explores the role that liberty plays in individual development, discusses criteria for permitting the state to limit individual actions, and suggests ways of confining the state to its proper bounds. In so doing, he uniquely combines the ancient concern for human excellence and the modern concern for what has come to be known as negative liberty.</p> <p><b>J. W. Burrow</b> is Professor of History at the University of Sussex.</p></p><p>This text is important both as one of the most interesting contributions to the liberalism of the German Enlightenment, and as the most significant source for the ideas which John Stuart Mill popularized in his essay On Liberty. Humboldt&#39;s concern is to define the criteria by which the permissible limits of the state&#39;s activities may be determined.Burrow is professor of European thought at Oxford University and fellow of Balliol College.</p><h2>Readings in Greek History: Sources and Interpretations</h2><p>An ideal reader for courses in Greek history, Greek civilization, and Western civilization, this comprehensive collection of more than 180 historical source documents covers major aspects of Greek civilization from the Archaic Age through the end of the Hellenistic Period.

He aims to recover Shakespeare's ideas and beliefs and to make his work once again a recognized source for the serious study of moral and political problems.<br> <br> In essays looking at <i>Julius Caesar, Othello,</i> and <i>The Merchant of Venice,</i> Bloom shows how Shakespeare presents a picture of man that does not assume privileged access for only literary criticism. With this claim, he argues that political philosophy offers a comprehensive framework within which the problems of the Shakespearean heroes can be viewed. In short, he argues that Shakespeare was an eminently political author. Also included is an essay by Harry V. Jaffa on the limits of politics in <i>King Lear.</i><br> <br> "A very good book indeed . . . one which can be recommended to all who are interested in Shakespeare." &#x2014;G. P. V. Akrigg<br> <br> "This series of essays reminded me of the scope and depth of Shakespeare's original vision. One is left with the impression that Shakespeare really had figured out the answers to some important questions many of us no longer even know to ask."-Peter A.

Andrew Bowie offers an accessible introduction to the work, among others, of Kant, Herder, Fichte, the Romantics, Schelling, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, Frege, Wittgenstein, the Vienna Circle, Husserl, Heidegger, Benjamin, Adorno, Gadamer and Habermas. Modern German philosophy is proving to be more and more important to the study of all areas of the humanities.

It covers the most important points of German grammar in the clearest possible manner, stressing regularities rather than irregularities and concentrating upon the constructions and expression-modes that you would be most likely to use. It has been created for readers who prefer the phrase-approach, and all grammatical points are illustrated with phrases and sentences that you can use immediately. Hints are included throughout the book on replacing difficult constructions with easier ones.<br>The basic presentation technique has been able to evoke the strong similarities between English and German, rather than the differences. As a result it is easier for you to understand and imitate German speech patterns. Among other unusual features of this grammar are: a means of avoiding most of the intricacies of noun declension; a logical, easily followed presentation of verbs compounded with separable or inseparable prefixes; a statement on word order that enables you to see English parallels; and an immediately useful presentation of basic German grammar.<br>This grammar does not assume knowledge of grammatical terms (a supplement explains English grammatical terms) or of German grammar.</p><p></p><h2>New Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors</h2><p>The <em>New Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors </em>is the essential A to Z guide for anyone who works with words. <br>Endorsed by the Society for Editors and Proofreaders, it offers invaluable support on 25,000 words that most frequently cause writers or editors confusion.

It takes the unique step of setting up an imaginary dialogue on the central concepts of the Christian faith between the various authors of the New Testament themselves, thus capturing in a particularly fresh and lucid way the differing approaches and attempts of these first Christians to explore and elucidate their faith.<br></p><p>Generations of students have known G. B. Caird as a penetrating and lucid guide to the many questions and problems posed by modern biblical study. His brilliant commentaries on St Luke, the Book of Revelation, and St Paul&#39;s Prison Epistles, as well as his other studies on theology and the Bible, have won for him a place among the twentieth century&#39;s foremost biblical scholars. This new and masterly presentation of New Testament theology, completed and edited since the author&#39;s death by Professor L. D. Hurst, takes the unique step of setting up an imaginary debate amongst the various authors of the New Testament themselves. As central concepts (predestination, sin, atonement, the Church, sacrament, ethics, eschatology, and christology) are &#39;discussed&#39; between such figures as Luke, Paul, John, and the author of Hebrews, the work moves to its climax with a presentation of the theology of Jesus himself. The result is a particularly fresh and illuminating picture of the ideas at the heart of Christianity, deserving a place on the shelf of every serious pastor, theologian, and student of the Bible.G. B. Caird is at University of Oxford. L. D. Hurst is at University of California, Davis.</p><h2>Germans into Nazis</h2><p><p>Why did ordinary Germans vote for Hitler? In this dramatically plotted book, organized around crucial turning points in 1914, 1918, and 1933, Peter Fritzsche explains why the Nazis were so popular and what was behind the political choice made by the German people.</p><p>Rejecting the view that Germans voted for the Nazis simply because they hated the Jews, or had been humiliated in World War I, or had been ruined by the Great Depression, Fritzsche makes the controversial argument that Nazism was part of a larger process of democratization and political invigoration that began with the outbreak of World War I.</p><p>The twenty-year period beginning in 1914 was characterized by the steady advance of a broad populist revolution that was animated by war, drew strength from the Revolution of 1918, menaced the Weimar Republic, and finally culminated in the rise of the Nazis. Better than anyone else, the Nazis twisted together ideas from the political Left and Right, crossing nationalism with social reform, anti-Semitism with democracy, fear of the future with hope for a new beginning. This radical rebelliousness destroyed old authoritarian structures as much as it attacked liberal principles.</p><p>The outcome of this dramatic social revolution was a surprisingly popular regime that drew on public support to realize its horrible racial goals. Within a generation, Germans had grown increasingly self-reliant and sovereign, while intensely nationalistic and chauvinistic. They had recast the nation, but put it on the road to war and genocide.</p></p><p>One of the four key archival photographs in this history of the rise of the Nazi state shows a young, disheveled Hitler among the throng of "patriotic Germans gathered on Munich's Odeonsplatz to hear the declaration of war read aloud from the steps of the Feldherrnhalle on 2 August 1914." Fritzsche analyzes the exact significance of this moment to Hitler and the German population. To de-emphasize, in this manner, the Nazis' rise from the rubble of economic despair and hardship and to posit their birth in this popular movement represents a shift in the more conventional historic point of view that dates Nazism at the end of World War I (1918). In the moment captured by this photograph, the German <i>Volk</i> was in the process of being born.<p> The <i>Volk</i> becomes a crucial entity as Fritzsche scrutinizes the evolution of Germans into Nazis. The Nazis rose to power "because [they] spoke so well to [the peoples'] interests and inclinations. Given the illiberal aims and violent means of the Nazis, this popular support is a sobering, dreadful thing." The Nazi revolution offered a complex and vicious intertwining of the Left and Right that amounted to a reckless rebelliousness and the crossing of nationalism with social reform, anti-Semitism with democracy, and paranoia with nationalistic zeal for a new beginning. Their rise spanned a remarkably short period--from 1914 to 1933. Each of the four chapters opens with an archival photograph that represents a key point in the evolution of this dreadful rise.</p><p> The pivotal November 1918 event, for example, was the call by the <i>Volk</i> for the abdication of the Kaiser, exemplified by the unprecedented demonstration of socialist workers in the government quarters. It would take just a few hours for the old order to crumble and Germany to declare itself a socialist republic. Leap ahead to January 1933. Hitler had just been made chancellor of Germany. Here is a description of the swelling crowds and celebratory atmosphere: "Nearly one million Berliners took part in this extraordinary demonstration of allegiance to a party that promised to do away with both the sentimental bric-a-brac of the prewar past and the clutter of Weimar democracy and to establish a strong-willed and strong-armed racial state...." In the meantime, Communists, Socialists, and Jews were being severely beaten. Fritzsche cites the dramatic overpowering of German towns and the harrowing popularity of Nazi brutality as he sheds light on Hitler's immense popularity. Fervent nationalism and an overarching anti-Semitism weigh in heavily. This is a history that seeks not to exonerate but to tell the cautionary tale. <i>--Hollis Giammatteo</i></p>Peter Fritzsche, in his Germans into Nazis, makes a...crucial point about public opinion in the 1930s and 1940s. He recalls-and this is something that foreigners living in Germany have always understood more readily than academics-that the popular appeal of Hitler&#39;s movement lay much more in the hope and optimism it generated than in its various invitations to hate and to fear.-Neal Ascherson, Los Angeles Times Book Review</p><h2>Quarks and Leptons: An Introductory Course in Modern Particle Physics</h2><p>This self-contained text describes breakthroughs in our understanding of the structure and interactions of elementary particles.

Through this article, Singer presents his view that we have the same moral obligations to those far away as we do to those close to us. He argued that choosing not to send life-saving money to starving people on the other side of the earth is the moral equivalent of neglecting to save drowning children because we prefer not to muddy our shoes. If we can help, we must--and any excuse is hypocrisy. Singer's extreme stand on our moral obligations to others became a powerful call to arms and continues to challenge people's attitudes towards extreme poverty. Today, it remains a central touchstone for those who argue we should all help others more than we do.<br> <br>As Bill and Melinda Gates observe in their foreword, in the age of today's global philanthropy, Singer's essay is as relevant now as it ever was. This attractively packaged, concise edition collects the original article, two of Singer's more recent popular writings on our obligations to others around the world, and a new introduction by Singer that discusses his current thinking.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter Singer </strong>has been described as the world's most influential philosopher. His books include <em>Animal Liberation,</em> <em>Practical Ethics</em>, <em>Rethinking Life and Death</em>, <em>One World</em>, <em>The Life You Can Save,</em> and <em>The Point of View of the Universe</em>. In 2014 the Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute ranked him third on its list of Global Thought Leaders, and <em>Time</em> has ranked him among the world's 100 most influential people.<br><br>"Peter Singer's 'Famine, Affluence, and Morality' is the single most important text in applied ethics. Singer gives us the simplest and most powerful argument in modern philosophy that we must change the way we live fundamentally." --Leif Wenar, Kings College London <br><p></p><br>"Singer's <em>Famine, Affluence, and Morality</em> is an important influential argument that better off people should do more to alleviate poverty. Everyone should read it." --Gilbert Harman, Princeton University <br><p></p><br>"<em>Famine, Affluence and Morality</em>, by a world renowned philosopher, is a must read, particularly for students and scholars of philosophy, sociology, and politics interested in world affairs, poverty and social justice." -- <em>International Dialogue, A Multidisciplinary Journal of World Affairs</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Cambridge Companion to Gothic Fiction (Cambridge Companions to Literature)</h2><p>Fourteen world-class experts on the Gothic provide thorough accounts of this haunting-to-horrifying genre from the 1760s to the end of the twentieth century. Essays explore the connections of Gothic fictions to political and industrial revolutions, the realistic novel, the theater, Romantic and post-Romantic poetry, nationalism and racism from Europe to America, colonized and post-colonial populations, the rise of film, the struggles between &#34;high&#34; and &#34;popular&#34; culture, and changing attitudes towards human identity, life and death, sanity and madness. The volume also includes a chronology and guides to further reading.</p><p>Jerrold E. Hogle is Professor of English and University Distinguished Professor at the University of Arizona. He has published widely in Romantic literature, cultural theory, and the Gothic.&#34;Contributors also emphasize that the &#39;gothic&#39; novel was not strictly English, but that it had many more outreaches.

After all, you wouldn't expect an <em>Oxford Roald Dahl Dictionary</em> to be ordinary, would you? Lots of dictionaries tell you what an "alligator" is, or how to spell "balloon" but they won't explain the difference between a "ringbeller" and a "trogglehumper," or say why witches need "gruntles' eggs" or suggest a word for the shape of a "Knid."<br><br>All the words that Roald Dahl invented are here, like "biffsquiggled" and "whizzpopping," to remind you what means what. You'll also find out where words came from, rhyming words, synonyms and lots of alternative words for words that are overused. <br><br>Oxford Children's Dictionaries are perfect for supporting literacy and learning and this is the world's first <em>Roald Dahl Dictionary</em> from the word experts at Oxford University Press. With real citations from Roald Dahl's children's books and illustrations by Quentin Blake, the <em>Oxford Roald Dahl</em> <em>Dictionary</em> will inspire and encourage young writers and readers.<br></p><p><br><strong>Susan Rennie </strong>has worked on many dictionaries for both children and adults, including the <em>Oxford Primary Dictionary, Oxford Primary Thesaurus</em>, the <em>Oxford English Thesaurus for Schools</em> and the <em>New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary.</em> She also writes books in Scots for children, and has translated the first Scots edition of <em>Tintin</em>. Susan is currently a Lecturer in English Language at the University of Glasgow where she teaches lexicography and the history of Scots and English.<br><br>"It's hard to find the right word to express our levels of excitement around the <em>Oxford Roald Dahl Dictionary</em>. Squacking? Jumpsquiffling? Gigantuous? Roald Dahl's inventive, playful use of language is such a key element of his writing, whether he was using existing words in his own mischievous way or inventing extra-usual new ones. It is wonderful to have this dictionary compiled with such expertise, passion and wit by Dr. Susan Rennie and the team at OUP. There could be no more fitting way to pay tribute to Roald Dahl in the year of celebrations for his centenary. Best of all, as a fully-functioning dictionary for readers and writers aged eight and above, I hope it serves as a swashboggling source of inspiration for a whole new generation of storytellers." <br>-- Luke Kelly, Managing Director of the Roald Dahl Literary Estate and Roald Dahl's grandson<p></p><br>"A great way for an established fan to spend time in the scrumdiddlyumptious space that is [Dahl's] world. Bonus points if you like to gobblefunk." --<em>The Horn Book</em><p></p><br>"For children who devour the stories of Roald Dahl, and for parents who dearly wish to encourage their children's interest in words and reading, comes a spliffling, gloriumptious, whoopsey-splunkers compilation of the vocabulary (both real and confected) that the great Dahl used in 'The BFG,' 'Matilda' and other books. Sprinkled with Quentin Blake's witty, ebullient illustrations, 'The Oxford Roald Dahl Dictionary' is cleverly organized by Susan Rennie to work partly as a word guide and partly as a spur to gobblefunk with words (without erroneously biffsquiggling, of course) like the master himself." --<em>The Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"The best dictionary for children this year." --<em>New York Journal of Books</em><p></p><br>"This delightful book compiled by Rennie goes beyond any typical dictionary for children... Educators who are using Dahl's fiction or poems in the classroom will find this an excellent supplementary text for inspiring children to play with words. Highly recommended." --<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Elements of X-Ray Diffraction</h2><p><p> <b> </b> Intended to acquaint the reader with the theory of x-ray diffraction, the experimental methods involved, and the main applications. The book is a collection of principles and methods stressing X-ray diffraction rather than metallurgy. <b> </b> The book is written entirely in terms of the Bragg law and can be read without any knowledge of the reciprocal lattice. It is divided into three main parts&#x2014;Fundamentals; experimental methods; and applications. <b> </b> Designed for beginners, not as a reference tool for the advanced reader. </p></p><p>Preface <p> This edition appears over twenty years after the Second Edition was released. That the Second Edition, without revision, continued as a popular materials text and as a reference book is a tribute to Professor Cullity's clarity and thoroughness. </p><p> Instrumentation and techniques have changed considerably, however, in the intervening twenty years, engendered by the revolution in distributed computing heralded by the advent of the personal computer. In the Fall of 1973, for example, I ran BASIC programs from one of many teletypes connected to a single PDP-8 computer with 8 Bytes of memory. I recently came across loan papers from 1984 for my personal computer (256 Bytes RAM, no hard drive). Analyses which required graphical solution before computers or very astute programming in the first digital decades now can be done using spreadsheets packaged with word processing software; the earlier approaches are no longer of interest, except perhaps to historians. </p><p> With changes in instruments came changes in the types of x-ray diffraction experiments a materials scientist/engineer might be required to perform (or at least to interpret). Film-based techniques for powder diffraction fell into relative obscurity while diffractometry (parafocusing geometry) with electronic detectors assumed the principle role. The Second Edition, however, followed the First Edition in treating x-ray diffraction first from the standpoint of photographic methods and second from that of diffractometry; this edition changes emphasis to diffractometry as the primary technique. Practical considerations dictate this change: any x-ray diffraction data collection/analysis that the students subsequently encounter will almost surely be diffractometry, and most instructors emphasize these experiments. If the students are to understand their laboratory sessions, which must begin early in the term, diffractometry must be pushed forward in the course. Unfortunately, this requires a progression different from the very satisfactory approach used before: a single crystal diffracting many wavelengths in all directions, a polycrystal sample diffracting one wavelength in many directions, an apparatus sampling a small section of diffraction cones along a particular direction. I predict, however, that the second decade of the new millennium will see the area detector methods regain the prominence once held by photographic methods. </p><p> Yet another challenge was integrating reciprocal lattice treatment of diffraction into the text and adding reforming the material on diffraction from nearly perfect crystals. Since the Second Edition appeared, several topics have grown in importance in different segments of the materials community, diffraction from polymers and small angle scattering, and this is reflected in two new chapters. Finally, materials engineers n6ed some familiarity with transmission electron microscopy, and a couple of weeks, building on reciprocal lattice concepts developed earlier, at the end of a semester course on x-ray diffraction and crystal structure may be all that can be spared. To support this possibility, a brief summary of the high points of TEM in materials characterization is provided. </p><p> This revision took a long time to be completed, and I am grateful to the various editors who helped it along: Dan Jorananstad, Rob Merino, Laura Curless and especially Michael Slaughter and Scott Disanno, and also their staffs. I am grateful to the various reviewers for their advice: Z.L. Wang, Steve Spooner and Ray Young. I apologize to those who were forced to wait for me to finish this revision, but the revision was done without taking leave from my academic duties and this delay was the result. </p><p> Virtually all scholars blend research and teaching to various degrees, and I am no exception. It is difficult to imagine how this revision it might have been completed without the confidence of having a stable base of research funding provided by the U.S. Office of Naval Research; I am, therefore, very grateful to ONR and George Yoder. </p><p> I am very grateful to various mentors who laid the foundation on which this revision is based: Neva Gribble, John Hilliard, M. Meshii, Morrie Fine, Howard Birnbaum, Haydn Chen, Keith Bowen, Jerry Cohen, Brett Boston and Jane Deakins, and R. A. Young. I learned much from many others, and I apologize to them for not explicitly recognizing my debt to them. I am also very grateful to the numerous students from the diffraction classes I have taught and to my own research students, undergraduate, Masters and PhD; it would be hard to find a better bunch anywhere. I am grateful to Vinnie Holohan who helped prepare many of the new figures and to Lisa Novak who helped with the more complex equations.</p></p><h2>Music in Theory and Practice Volume 2</h2><p>This best-selling text gives music majors and minors a solid foundation in the theory of music. It strengthens their musical intuition, builds technical skills, and helps them gain interpretive insights. The goal of the text is to instruct readers on the practical application of knowledge. The analytical techniques presented are carefully designed to be clear, uncomplicated, and readily applicable to any repertoire. <br><br>The two-volume format ensures exhaustive coverage and maximum support for students and faculty alike. Volume I serves as a general introduction to music theory while volume II offers a survey of the theoretical underpinnings of musical styles and forms from Gregorian Chant through the present day. The supplemental instructor's materials provide clear-cut solutions to assignment materials. <em>Music in Theory and Practice</em> is a well-rounded textbook that integrates the various components of musical structure and makes them accessible to students at the undergraduate level.</p><p>Bruce Benward has been widely regarded as one of the most gifted music theory pedagogues since his textbooks first appeared in the 1960s, and has exerted a wide influence on the teaching of music theory both through his writings and through the generation of teachers that he taught. He recently retired from the University of Wisconsin at Madison.</p><h2>Traffic and Highway Engineering</h2><p>The new edition of Garber and Hoel&#39;s best-selling TRAFFIC AND HIGHWAY ENGINEERING focuses on giving students insight into all facets of traffic and highway engineering. Students generally come to this course with little knowledge or understanding of the importance of transportation, much less of the extensive career opportunities within the field. Transportation is an extremely broad field, and courses must either cover all transportation modes or focus on specifics. While many topics can be covered with a survey approach, this often lacks sufficient depth and students leave the course without a full understanding of any of the fields. This text focuses exclusively on traffic and highway engineering beginning with a discussion of the pivotal role transportation plays in our society, including employment opportunities, historical impact, and the impact of transportation on our daily lives. This approach gives students a sense of what the field is about as well as an opportunity to consider some of its challenges. Later chapters focus on specific issues facing transportation engineers. The text uses pedagogical tools such as worked problems, diagrams and tables, reference material, and realistic examples to demonstrate how the material is applied.</p><p>Nicholas J. Garber is the Henry L. Kinnier Emeritus Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Virginia, where he served as Chairman of the Department from 1996 to 2002. Before joining the University of Virginia, Dr. Garber was Professor of Civil Engineering in the faculty of engineering at the University of Sierra Leone, where he was also the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering. At the State University of New York at Buffalo, he played an important role in the development of the graduate program in transportation engineering.

This new edition contains a new subsection on intersectionality. New readings turn readers&#x2019; attention to current debates about violence against women, sex work, care work, transfeminisms, and postfeminism. The fourth edition also continues to expand the diverse voices of transnational feminist scholars throughout, with particular attention to questions of class.</p> <p></p> <p>Introductory essays at the beginning of each section bring the readings together, provide historical and intellectual context, and point to critical additional readings. Five core theoretical concepts&#x2015;gender, difference, women&#x2019;s experiences, the personal is political, and intersectionality&#x2015;anchor the anthology&#x2019;s organizational framework. New to this edition, text boxes in the introductory essays add excerpts from the writings of foundational theorists that help define important theoretical concepts,&nbsp;and&nbsp;content by Dorothy Sue Cobble, Cathy Cohen, Emi Koyama, Na Young Lee, Angela McRobbie, Viviane Namaste, Vrushali Patil, and Jasbir Puar.</p></p><p><p><strong>Carole R.

Maintaining its transnational approach, the fourth edition includes new readings on topics such as globalized intimate labor, transfeminism, and tensions within intersectional theory. Expanded intellectual histories of key concepts in the revised chapter introductions help readers to negotiate the currents of debate within the field. This edition of the <i>Feminist Theory Reader </i>is an ideal text for anyone seeking to become an informed, critical and reflexive thinker and activist for social justice. </p> <p>Suzanne Bergeron, Professor of Women's Studies and Social Sciences, University of Michigan Dearborn </p> <p>While continuing in the tradition of their previous editions of the <i>Feminist Theory Reader, </i>editors Carol McCann and Seung-kyung Kim&#x2019;s new edition provides<i> </i>more readings on transnational and global feminist perspectives by women of color and women from the global south. The essays address key theoretical issues of gender, race, nationality, sexual identity, and postcolonialism. The editors have selected articles that analyze the nuances of such issues as gender differences, women&#x2019;s diverse experiences, the legacy and contemporary impact of "the personal is political," and the ongoing theoretical discourse on intersectionality as well as the interrelationships among these. Although many of the works included in the <i>Feminist Theory Reader</i> address the ongoing tensions, ambiguities, and contradictions within key feminist theories, the editors conclude their anthology with a series of thought-provoking readings that address emergent and shifting feminist theories and political praxis. The <i>Feminist Theory Reader </i>is<i> </i>an essential anthology for advanced undergraduates and graduate students. Professors who teach feminist theory must have this anthology on their undergraduate and graduate syllabi. </p> <p>Alma M.

Paideia, the shaping of Greek character through a union of civilization, tradition, literature, and philosophy is the basis for Jaeger's evaluation of Hellenic culture.<br>Volume I describes the foundation, growth, and crisis of Greek culture during the archaic and classical epochs, ending with the collapse of the Athenian empire. The second and third volumes of the work deal with the intellectual history of ancient Greece in the Age of Plato, the 4th century B.C.--the age in which Greece lost everything that is valued in this world--state, power, liberty--but still clung to the concept of paideia. As its last great poet, Menander summarized the primary role of this ideal in Greek culture when he said: "The possession which no one can take away from man is paideia."<br></p><p>Werner Jaeger&#39;s acclaimed three-volume work treats PAIDEIA, the shaping of Greek character, as the basis for a study of Hellenism as a whole, to explain the interaction between the historical process by which Greek character was formed and the intellectual process by which they constructed their ideal of the human personality. This first volume describes the flowering of Greek culture during the archaic and classical epochs that preceded the fall of Athens at the end of the Peloponnesian Wars, at the beginning of the fourth century B.C.Werner Jaeger is at Harvard University.</p><h2>Contemporary Organizational Behavior: From Ideas to Action</h2><p><p> <b>Applying Organizational Behavior</b> </p> <b> <i>Contemporary Organizational Behavior: From Ideas to Action</i> </b> is an unconventional text that approaches Organizational Behavior in conceptual, contextual, and experiential ways.

Miron argues that prohibition&#39;s effects on drug use have been modest and that prohibition has numerous side effects, most of them highly undesirable. In particular, prohibition is shown to directly increase violent crime, even in cases where it deters drug use. Miron&#39;s analysis leads to a disturbing finding-the more resources given to the fight against drugs, the greater the homicide rate. The costs and benefits of several alternatives to the war on drugs are examined. The conclusion is unequivocal and states that any of the most widely discussed alternatives is likely to be a substantial improvement over current policy.</p><p><b>Jeffrey A. Miron</b> is professor of economics at Boston University. His articles on drug policy have appeared in <i>Social Research</i>, <i>Journal of Law and Economics</i>, <i>Boston Globe</i>, and the <i>London Observer</i>. He received his Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."A powerful economic analysis...advances the only practical alternative to the present failed policies." -- <i>Joseph D. MacNamara, former Chief of Police of San Jose, California</i><br><br>"Jeffrey Miron strengthens and enriches the case with his analyses of data from the prohibition era and from other countries" -- <i>Steven B. Duke, professor of law, Yale University</i><br><br>"Legislators and other policy-makers would benefit from his non-politicized, non-moralistic approach; everyone can benefit from reading this important, insightful work." -- <i>Margaret M. Russell, vice president, ACLU</i><br><br>"[T]he standard for judging all else in the field . . . has been needed for a very long time." -- <i>John L. Kane, Jr., senior judge, U.S. District Court</i></p><h2>Science as Social Knowledge: Values and Objectivity in Scientific Inquiry</h2><p><p>Conventional wisdom has it that the sciences, properly pursued, constitute a pure, value-free method of obtaining knowledge about the natural world. In light of the social and normative dimensions of many scientific debates, Helen Longino finds that general accounts of scientific methodology cannot support this common belief. Focusing on the notion of evidence, the author argues that a methodology powerful enough to account for theories of any scope and depth is incapable of ruling out the influence of social and cultural values in the very structuring of knowledge. The objectivity of scientific inquiry can nevertheless be maintained, she proposes, by understanding scientific inquiry as a social rather than an individual process. Seeking to open a dialogue between methodologists and social critics of the sciences, Longino develops this concept of "contextual empiricism" in an analysis of research programs that have drawn criticism from feminists. Examining theories of human evolution and of prenatal hormonal determination of "gender-role" behavior, of sex differences in cognition, and of sexual orientation, the author shows how assumptions laden with social values affect the description, presentation, and interpretation of data. In particular, Longino argues that research on the hormonal basis of "sex-differentiated behavior" involves assumptions not only about gender relations but also about human action and agency. She concludes with a discussion of the relation between science, values, and ideology, based on the work of Habermas, Foucault, Keller, and Haraway.</p></p><p><p>"Helen Longino has written a timely book that fills a critical gap in the existing literature between philosophy of science and the social studies of science. Her exposition of scientific inquiry as a context-laden process provides the conceptual tools we need to understand how social expectations shape the development of science while at the same time recognizing the dependence of scientific inquiry on its interactions with natural phenomena. This is an important book precisely because there is none other quite like it."--<b>Evelyn Fox Keller, author of <i>Reflections on Gender and Science</i></b></p></p><h2>Resolving Disputes: Theory, Practice, and Law (Aspen Casebook)</h2><p><p><em><strong>Resolving Disputes: Theory, Practice, and Law, Third Edition</strong></em>, features a logical four-part organization that covers negotiation, mediation, arbitration, and hybrid approaches, which prepares law students to represent clients in all forms of alternative dispute resolution.

Another of its distinctive features is that it shows how the need for expressive power and for drawing distinctions forces formal language development. This volume is ideal as an introduction to formal logic, philosophical logic, and philosophy of language. At each stage of system elaboration and development, the book answers meta-logical questions. Why is a particular formalism needed? What must go into such a formalism and why? These questions engage students in a collective inquiry which allows them to see logical studies as a human enterprise aimed at achieving well understood goals - clarity and good reasoning. The second edition extends and systematizes the account of anaphora, including "donkey" anaphora, plural anaphora, and cross-sentential anaphora. It also has additional sections on counter-models and semantics, and contains additional exercises and an updated bibliography. This update of the second edition includes over a dozen additional problem sets and revisions throughout.<b>Ernest Lepore</b> is Director of the Center for Cognitive Science at Rutgers University.

It was a world where Deep South cotton planters clashed with South Carolina rice growers, where the egalitarian spirit sweeping the North seeped down through border states already uncertain about slavery, where even sections of the same state (for instance, coastal and mountain Virginia) divided bitterly on key issues. It was the world of Jefferson Davis, John C. Calhoun, Andrew Jackson, and Thomas Jefferson, and also of Gullah Jack, Nat Turner, and Frederick Douglass. <br> Now, in the first volume of his long awaited, monumental study of the South's road to disunion, historian William Freehling offers a sweeping political and social history of the antebellum South from 1776 to 1854. All the dramatic events leading to secession are here: the Missouri Compromise, the Nullification Controversy, the Gag Rule ("the Pearl Harbor of the slavery controversy"), the Annexation of Texas, the Compromise of 1850, and the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Freehling vividly recounts each crisis, illuminating complex issues and sketching colorful portraits of major figures. Along the way, he reveals the surprising extent to which slavery influenced national politics before 1850, and he provides important reinterpretations of American republicanism, Jeffersonian states' rights, Jacksonian democracy, and the causes of the American Civil War. <br> But for all Freehling's brilliant insight into American antebellum politics, <em>Secessionists at Bay</em> is at bottom the saga of the rich social tapestry of the pre-war South. He takes us to old Charleston, Natchez, and Nashville, to the big house of a typical plantation, and we feel anew the tensions between the slaveowner and his family, the poor whites and the planters, the established South and the newer South, and especially between the slave and his master, "Cuffee" and "Massa." Freehling brings the Old South back to life in all its color, cruelty, and diversity. It is a memorable portrait, certain to be a key analysis of this crucial era in American history.<br></p><p>In the first volume of his long-awaited, monumental study of the South&#39;s road to disunion, eminent historian William W.

It is a comprehensive reference that offers brief overviews of pregnancy, the intrapartum and postpartum periods, as well as gynecological and medical conditions that impact childbearing. Complications are described and a brief overview of medical management is included for giving women anticipatory guidance when they are referred for physician care. The midwifery management also incorporates complementary measures such as herbal remedies, reflexology, Chinese medicine and nutritional strategies. Provides nurse midwives quick access to important clinical information that is detailed, generally has not been memorized, or that discusses issues which are encountered infrequently enough that a quick review of the details is helpful when the situation arises. Consistent presentation in each chapter begins with a brief definition of the problem, diagnostic tests and labs, differential diagnosis where appropriate, and concludes with a decision-making tree to assist in the decision making process. Nurse-midwifery management guidelines are included throughout to provide the practitioner with important information such as when to manage independently or when to consult with the physician. Unique! Integrates alternative and complementary therapies along with key medical information specific to midwifery practice to provide practitioners with complete care alternatives.</p><p>Constance Sinclair, CNM, MSN, Nurse-Midwife, Kaiser Permanente Medical Center; Preceptor, Nurse-Midwifery Program, Kaiser Permanente, Santa Rosa, CA; Formerly, Faculty of the University of Pennsylvania, Nurse Midwifery Program, Philadelphia, PA</p><h2>Troubleshooting Analog Circuits (EDN Series for Design Engineers)</h2><p>Based on the author's popular series in EDN Magazine, the book contains a wealth of information on debugging and troubleshooting analog circuits.

This is a user-friendly and potentially life-changing introduction to the wisdom teachings of over 108 of the greatest mystics in the Western tradition. Its premise is that we all need teachers and companions to assist us in developing rich interior lives. It celebrates the universal power and wisdom of the teachings of the mystics, highlighting the ways in which their words can help anyone find greater love, purpose, and a deeper sense of God's presence.<br>McColman organizes the mystics into nine categories: visionaries, confessors, lovers, poets, saints, heretics, wisdom keepers, soul-friends, and unitives. He covers a wide range of Christian mystics including Howard Thurman, Hildegard of Bingen, Julian of Norwich, Gregory of Palamus, and C.S. Lewis.<br>This informative volume will appeal to those who buy religious reference books and those interested in spirituality.</p><p><b>Carl McColman</b> lives near Atlanta, Georgia, where he is the member of the Lay Cistercians of Our Lady of the Holy Spirit&#x2015;a contemplative community under the spiritual guidance of Trappist monks.

I love that Carl McColman chose this esoteric vessel to hold the perennial wisdom of the Christian mystics.

He lives in Edinburgh, Scotland, with his wife and their two sons.Hide!&#x2019; <p></p>He was shrieking now, frantic, his face drained of all colour. She was at the top of the stairs, and he stumbled towards her, grabbing her by the arms, propelling her downstairs with unfocussed force, so that she feared they would both fall. She cried out. <p></p>&#x2018;Ronnie! Hide from who?&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Hide!&#x2019; he shrieked again. &#x2018;Hide! They&#x2019;re coming! They&#x2019;re coming!&#x2019; <p></p>He had pushed her all the way to the front door now. She&#x2019;d seen him pretty strung out before, but never this bad. A fix would help him, she knew it would. And she knew, too, that he had the makings upstairs in his bedroom. The sweat trickled from his chilled rat&#x2019;s-tails of hair. Only two minutes ago, the most important decision in her life had been whether or not to dare a trip to the squat&#x2019;s seething lavatory. But now&#x2026;. <p></p>&#x2018;They&#x2019;re coming,&#x2019; he repeated, his voice a whisper now. &#x2018;Hide.&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Ronnie,&#x2019; she said, &#x2018;you&#x2019;re scaring me.&#x2019; <p></p>He stared at her, his eyes seeming almost to recognise her. Then he looked away again, into a distance all of his own. The word was a snakelike hiss. <p></p>&#x2018;Hide.&#x2019; And with that he yanked open the door. It was raining outside, and she hesitated. But then fear took her, and she made to cross the threshold. But his hand grabbed at her arm, pulling her back inside. He embraced her, his sweat sea-salty, his body throbbing. His mouth was close to her ear, his breath hot. <p></p>&#x2018;They&#x2019;ve murdered me,&#x2019; he said. Then with sudden ferocity he pushed her again, and this time she was outside, and the door was slamming shut, leaving him alone in the house. Alone with himself. She stood on the garden path, staring at the door, trying to decide whether to knock or not. <p></p>It wouldn&#x2019;t make any difference. She knew that. So instead she started to cry. Her head slipped forward in a rare show of self-pity and she wept for a full minute, before, breathing hard three times, she turned and walked quickly down the garden path (such as it was). Someone would take her in. Someone would comfort her and take away the fear and dry her clothes. <p></p>Someone always did. <p></p>JOHN REBUS stared hard at the dish in front of him, oblivious to the conversation around the table, the background music, the flickering candles. He didn&#x2019;t really care about house prices in Barnton, or the latest delicatessen to be opened in the Grassmarket. He didn&#x2019;t much want to speak to the other guests&#x2014;a female lecturer to his right, a male bookseller to his left&#x2014;about&#x2026; well, what ever they&#x2019;d just been discussing. Yes, it was the perfect dinner party, the conversation as tangy as the starter course, and he was glad Rian had invited him. Of course he was. But the more he stared at the half lobster on his plate, the more an unfocussed despair grew within him. What had he in common with these people? Would they laugh if he told the story of the police alsatian and the severed head? No, they would not. They would smile politely, then bow their heads towards their plates, acknowledging that he was&#x2026; well, <i>different</i> from them. <p></p>&#x2018;Vegetables, John?&#x2019; <p></p>It was Rian&#x2019;s voice, warning him that he was not &#x2018;taking part&#x2019;, was not &#x2018;conversing&#x2019; or even looking interested. He accepted the large oval dish with a smile, but avoided her eyes. <p></p>She was a nice girl. Quite a stunner in an individual sort of way. Bright red hair, cut short and pageboyish. Eyes deep, striking green. Lips thin but promising. Oh yes, he liked her. He wouldn&#x2019;t have accepted her invitation otherwise. He fished about in the dish for a piece of broccoli that wouldn&#x2019;t break into a thousand pieces as he tried to manoeuvre it onto his plate. <p></p>&#x2018;Gorgeous food, Rian,&#x2019; said the bookseller, and Rian smiled, accepting the remark, her face reddening slightly. That was all it took, John. That was all you had to say to make this girl happy. But in his mouth he knew it would come out sounding sarcastic. His tone of voice was not something he could suddenly throw off like a piece of clothing. It was a part of him, nurtured over a course of years. So when the lecturer agreed with the bookseller, all John Rebus did was smile and nod, the smile too fixed, the nod going on a second or two too long, so that they were all looking at him again. The piece of broccoli snapped into two neat halves above his plate and splattered onto the tablecloth. <p></p>&#x2018;Shite!&#x2019; he said, knowing as the word escaped his lips that it was not quite appropriate, not quite the <i>right</i> word for the occasion. Well, what was he, a man or a thesaurus? <p></p>&#x2018;Sorry,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Couldn&#x2019;t be helped,&#x2019; said Rian. My God, her voice was cold. <p></p>It was the perfect end to a perfect weekend. He&#x2019;d gone shopping on Saturday, ostensibly for a suit to wear tonight. But had baulked at the prices, and bought some books instead, one of which was intended as a gift to Rian: <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>. But then he&#x2019;d decided he&#x2019;d like to read it himself first, and so had brought flowers and chocolates instead, forgetting her aversion to lilies ( <i>had he known in the first place?</i>) and the diet she was in the throes of starting. Damn. And to cap it all, he&#x2019;d tried a new church this morning, another Church of Scotland offering, not too far from his flat. The last one he&#x2019;d tried had seemed unbearably cold, promising nothing but sin and repentance, but this latest church had been the oppressive opposite: all love and joy and what was there to forgive anyway? So he&#x2019;d sung the hymns, then buggered off, leaving the minister with a handshake at the door and a promise of future attendance. <p></p>&#x2018;More wine, John?&#x2019; <p></p>This was the bookseller, proffering the bottle he&#x2019;d brought himself. It wasn&#x2019;t a bad little wine, actually, but the bookseller had talked about it with such unremitting pride that Rebus felt obliged to decline. The man frowned, but then was cheered to find this refusal left all the more for himself. He replenished his glass with vigour. <p></p>&#x2018;Cheers,&#x2019; he said. <p></p>The conversation returned to how busy Edinburgh seemed these days. Here was something with which Rebus could agree. This being the end of May, the tourists were almost in season. But there was more to it than that. If anyone had told him five years ago that in 1989 people would be emigrating north from the south of England to the Lothians, he&#x2019;d have laughed out loud. Now it was fact, and a fit topic for the dinner table. <p></p>Later, much later, the couple having departed, Rebus helped Rian with the dishes. <p></p>&#x2018;What was wrong with you?&#x2019; she said, but all he could think about was the minister&#x2019;s handshake, that confident grip which bespoke assurances of an afterlife. <p></p>&#x2018;Nothing,&#x2019; he said. &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s leave these till morning.&#x2019; <p></p>Rian stared at the kitchen, counting the used pots, the half-eaten lobster carcasses, the wine glasses smudged with grease. <p></p>&#x2018;Okay,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;What did you have in mind instead?&#x2019; <p></p>He raised his eyebrows slowly, then brought them down low over his eyes. His lips broadened into a smile which had about it a touch of the leer. She became coy. <p></p>&#x2018;Why, Inspector,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Is that supposed to be some kind of a clue?&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Here&#x2019;s another,&#x2019; he said, lunging at her, hugging her to him, his face buried in her neck. She squealed, clenched fists beating against his back. <p></p>&#x2018;Police brutality!&#x2019; she gasped. &#x2018;Help! Police, help!&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Yes, madam?&#x2019; he inquired, carrying her by the waist out of the kitchen, towards where the bedroom and the end of the weekend waited in shadow. <p></p>LATE EVE NING at a building site on the outskirts of Edinburgh. The contract was for the construction of an office development. A fifteen-foot-high fence separated the works from the main road. The road, too, was of recent vintage, built to help ease traffic congestion around the city. Built so that commuters could travel easily from their countryside dwellings to jobs in the city centre. <p></p>There were no cars on the road to night. The only sound came from the slow chug-chugging of a cement mixer on the site. A man was feeding it spadefuls of grey sand and remembering the far distant days when he had laboured on a building site. Hard graft it had been, but honest. <p></p>Two other men stood above a deep pit, staring down into it. &#x2018;Should do it,&#x2019; one said. <p></p>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; the other agreed. They began walking back to the car, an ageing purple Mercedes. <p></p>&#x2018;He must have some clout. I mean, to get us the keys to this place, to set all this up. Some clout.&#x2019; <p></p>&#x2018;Ours is not to ask questions, you know that.&#x2019; The man who spoke was the oldest of the three, and the only Calvinist. He opened the car boot. Inside, the body of a frail teenager lay crumpled, obviously dead. His skin was the colour of pencil shading, darkest where the bruises lay. <p></p>&#x2018;What a waste,&#x2019; said the Calvinist. <p></p>&#x2018;Aye,&#x2019; the other agreed. Together they lifted the body from the boot, and carried it gently towards the hole. It dropped softly to the bottom, one leg wedging up against the sticky clay sides, a trouser leg slipping to show a naked ankle. <p></p>&#x2018;All right,&#x2019; the Calvinist said to the cement man. &#x2018;Cover it, and let&#x2019;s get out of here.

Where once the many-columned Forest had thronged with warriors, now it was peopled with shadows. Crowded with disappointments.<br><br>They had lost. And they had not even fought a battle.<br><br>Mother Kyre, of course, saw it differently. &#x201c;We have come to terms, my king,&#x201d; she corrected, nibbling at her meat as primly as an old mare at a hay bale.<br><br>&#x201c;Terms?&#x201d; Skara stabbed furiously at her own uneaten food. &#x201c;My father died to hold Bail&#x2019;s Point, and you&#x2019;ve given its key to Grandmother Wexen without a blow struck. You&#x2019;ve promised the High King&#x2019;s warriors free passage across our land! What do you think &#x2018;lost&#x2019; would look like?&#x201d;<br><br>Mother Kyre turned her gaze on Skara with the usual infuriating calmness. &#x201c;Your grandfather dead in his howe, the women of Yaletoft weeping over the corpses of their sons, this hall made ashes and you, princess, wearing a slave&#x2019;s collar shackled to the High King&#x2019;s chair. That is what I think &#x2018;lost&#x2019; would look like. Which is why I say come to terms.&#x201d;<br><br>Stripped of his pride, King Fynn sagged like a sail without a mast. Skara had always thought her grandfather as unconquerable as Father Earth. She could not bear to see him like this. Or perhaps she could not bear to see how childish her belief in him had been.<br><br>She watched him swill down more ale, and belch, and toss his gilded cup aside to be refilled. &#x201c;What do you say, Blue Jenner?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In such royal company as this, my king, as little as I can.&#x201d;<br><br>Blue Jenner was a shifty old beggar, more raider than trader, his face as crudely chiseled, weathered and cracked as an old prow-beast. Had Skara been in charge he would not have been allowed on her docks, let alone at her high table.<br><br>Mother Kyre, of course, saw it differently. &#x201c;A captain is like a king, but of a ship rather than a country. Your experience might benefit Princess Skara.&#x201d;<br><br>The indignity of it. &#x201c;A lesson in politics from a pirate,&#x201d; Skara muttered to herself, &#x201c;and not even a successful one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mumble. How many hours have I spent teaching you the proper way for a princess to speak? For a queen to speak?&#x201d; Mother Kyre raised her chin and made her voice echo effortlessly from the rafters. &#x201c;If you judge your thoughts worth hearing, pronounce them proudly, push them to every corner of the chamber, fill the hall with your hopes and desires and make every listener share them! If you are ashamed of your thoughts, better to leave a silence. A smile costs nothing. You were saying?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well . . .&#x201d; Blue Jenner scratched at the few gray hairs still clinging to his weather-spotted scalp, evidently a place unknown to combs. &#x201c;Grandmother Wexen&#x2019;s crushed the rebellion in the Lowlands.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;With the help of this dog of hers, Bright Yilling, who worships no god but Death.&#x201d; Skara&#x2019;s grandfather snatched up his cup while the thrall was still pouring, ale spilling across the table. &#x201c;They say he lined the road to Skekenhouse with hanged men.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The High King&#x2019;s eyes turn north,&#x201d; Jenner went on. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s keen to bring Uthil and Grom-gil-Gorm to heel and Throvenland . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is in the way,&#x201d; finished Mother Kyre. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t slouch, Skara, it is unseemly.&#x201d;<br><br>Skara scowled, but she wriggled her shoulders up the chair a little anyway, closer to the board-stiff, neck-stretched, horribly unnatural pose the minister approved of. Sit as if you have a knife to your throat, she always said. The role of a princess is not to be comfortable.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a man used to living free, and I&#x2019;m no lover of Grandmother Wexen, or her One God, or her taxes, or her rules.&#x201d; Blue Jenner rubbed mournfully at his lopsided jaw. &#x201c;But when Mother Sea whips up the storm, a captain does what he must to save what he can. Freedom&#x2019;s worth nothing to the dead. Pride&#x2019;s worth little even to the living.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wise words.&#x201d; Mother Kyre wagged her finger at Skara. &#x201c;The beaten can win tomorrow. The dead have lost forever.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wisdom and cowardice can be hard to tell apart,&#x201d; snapped Skara.<br><br>The minister clenched her jaw. &#x201c;I swear I taught you wiser manners than to insult a guest. Nobility is shown not by the respect one is given by the highest, but the respect one gives to the lowly. Words are weapons. They should be handled with proper care.&#x201d;<br><br>Jenner waved any suggestion of offense gently away. &#x201c;No doubt Princess Skara has the right of it. I&#x2019;ve known many men far braver&#x2019;n me.&#x201d; He gave a sad smile, displaying a crooked set of teeth with several gaps. &#x201c;And seen most buried, one by one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bravery and long life rarely make good bedfellows,&#x201d; said the king, draining his cup again.<br><br>&#x201c;Kings and ale pair up no better,&#x201d; said Skara.<br><br>&#x201c;I have nothing left but ale, granddaughter. My warriors have abandoned me. My allies have deserted me. They swore fair-weather oaths, oak-firm while Mother Sun shone, prone to wilt when the clouds gather.&#x201d;<br><br>That was no secret. Day after day Skara had watched the docks, eager to see how many ships the Iron King Uthil of Gettland would bring, how many warriors would accompany the famous Grom-gil-Gorm of Vansterland. Day after day, as the leaves budded, then the leaves cast dappled shade, then the leaves turned brown and fell. They never came.<br><br>&#x201c;Loyalty is common in dogs but rare in men,&#x201d; observed Mother Kyre. &#x201c;A plan that relies on loyalty is worse than none at all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What then?&#x201d; asked Skara. &#x201c;A plan that relies on cowardice?&#x201d;<br><br>Old, her grandfather looked as he turned to her with misty eyes and brewer&#x2019;s breath. Old and beaten. &#x201c;You have always been brave, Skara. Braver than I. No doubt the blood of Bail flows in your veins.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your blood too, my king! You always told me only half a war is fought with swords. The other half is fought here.&#x201d; And Skara pressed one fingertip into the side of her head, so hard it hurt.<br><br>&#x201c;You have always been clever, Skara. Cleverer than I. The gods know you can talk the birds down from the sky when it pleases you. Fight that half of the war, then. Give me the deep cunning that can turn back the High King&#x2019;s armies and save our land and our people from Bright Yilling&#x2019;s sword. That can spare me from the shame of Grandmother Wexen&#x2019;s terms.&#x201d;<br><br>Skara looked down at the straw-covered floor, face burning. &#x201c;I wish I could.&#x201d; But she was a girl seventeen winters old and, Bail&#x2019;s blood or no, her head held no hero&#x2019;s answers. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Grandfather.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So am I, child.&#x201d; King Fynn slumped back and beckoned for more ale. &#x201c;So am I.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Skara.&#x201d;<br><br>She was snatched from troubled dreams and into darkness, Mother Kyre&#x2019;s face ghostly in the light of one flickering candle.<br><br>&#x201c;Skara, get up.&#x201d;<br><br>She fumbled back the furs, clumsy with sleep. Strange sounds outside. Shouting and laughter.<br><br>She rubbed her eyes. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You must go with Blue Jenner.&#x201d;<br><br>Skara saw the trader then, lurking in the doorway of her bedchamber. A black figure, shaggy-headed, eyes turned to the floor.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>Mother Kyre pulled her up by her arm. &#x201c;You must go now.&#x201d;<br><br>Skara was about to argue. As she always argued. Then she saw the minister&#x2019;s expression and it made her obey without a word spoken. She had never seen Mother Kyre afraid before.<br><br>It did not sound like laughter anymore, outside. Crying. Wild voices. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d; she managed to croak.<br><br>&#x201c;I made a terrible mistake.&#x201d; Mother Kyre&#x2019;s eyes darted to the door and back. &#x201c;I trusted Grandmother Wexen.&#x201d; She twisted the gold ring from Skara&#x2019;s arm. The one Bail the Builder once wore into battle, its ruby glistening dark as new-spilled blood in the candlelight. &#x201c;This is for you.&#x201d; She held it out to Blue Jenner. &#x201c;If you swear to see her safe to Thorlby.&#x201d;<br><br>The raider&#x2019;s eyes flickered guiltily up as he took it. &#x201c;I swear it. A sun-oath and a moon-oath.&#x201d;<br><br>Mother Kyre clutched painfully hard at both of Skara&#x2019;s hands. &#x201c;Whatever happens, you must live. That is your duty now. You must live and you must lead. You must fight for Throvenland. You must stand for her people if . . . if there is no one else.&#x201d;<br><br>Skara&#x2019;s throat was so tight with fear she could hardly speak. &#x201c;Fight? But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have taught you how. I have tried to. Words are weapons.&#x201d; The minister wiped tears from Skara&#x2019;s face that she had not even realized she had cried. &#x201c;Your grandfather was right, you are brave and you are clever. But now you must be strong. You are a child no longer. Always remember, the blood of Bail flows in your veins. Now go.&#x201d;<br><br>Skara padded barefoot through the darkness at Blue Jenner&#x2019;s heels, shivering in her shift, Mother Kyre&#x2019;s lessons so deep-rooted that even fearing for her life she worried over whether she was properly dressed. Flames beyond the narrow windows cast stabbing shadows across the straw-scattered floor. She heard panicked shouts. A dog barking, suddenly cut off. A heavy thudding as of a tree being felled.<br><br>As of axes at the door.<br><br>They stole into the guest room, where warriors had slept shoulder to shoulder a few months before. Now there was only Blue Jenner&#x2019;s threadbare blanket.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d; she whispered, hardly recognizing her own voice it came so thin and cracked.<br><br>&#x201c;Bright Yilling has come with his Companions,&#x201d; said Jenner, &#x201c;to settle Grandmother Wexen&#x2019;s debts. Yaletoft is already burning. I&#x2019;m sorry, princess.&#x201d;<br><br>Skara flinched as he slid something around her neck. A collar of twisted silver wire, a fine chain clinking faintly. The kind the Ingling girl who used to bind her hair had worn.<br><br>&#x201c;Am I a slave?&#x201d; she whispered, as Jenner buckled the other end about his wrist.<br><br>&#x201c;You must seem to be.&#x201d;<br><br>Skara shrank back at a crash outside, the clash of metal, and Jenner pressed her against the wall. He blew his candle out and dropped them into darkness. She saw him draw a knife, Father Moon glinting on its edge.<br><br>Howls now, beyond the door, high and horrible, the bellows of beasts not the voices of men. Skara squeezed her eyes shut, tears stinging the lids, and prayed. Mumbling, stuttering, meaningless prayers. Prayers to every god and none.<br><br>It is easy to be brave when the Last Door seems tiny for its distance, a far-off thing for other folk to worry about. Now she felt Death&#x2019;s chill breath on her neck and it froze the courage in her. How freely she had talked of cowardice the night before. Now she understood what it was.<br><br>A last long shriek, then silence almost worse than the noise had been. She felt herself drawn forward, Jenner&#x2019;s breath stale on her cheek.<br><br>&#x201c;We have to go.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m scared,&#x201d; she breathed.<br><br>&#x201c;So am I. But if we face &#x2019;em boldly we might talk our way free. If they find us hiding . . .&#x201d;<br><br>You can only conquer your fears by facing them, her grandfather used to say. Hide from them, and they conquer you. Jenner eased the door creaking open and Skara forced herself through after him, her knees trembling so badly they were nearly knocking together.<br><br>Her bare foot slid in something wet. A dead man sat beside the door, the straw all about him black with blood.<br><br>Borid, his name. A warrior who had served her father. He had carried Skara on his shoulders when she was little, so she could reach the peaches in the orchard under the walls of Bail&#x2019;s Point.<br><br>Her stinging eyes crept toward the sound of voices. Over broken weapons and cloven shields. Over more corpses, hunched, sprawled, spread-eagled among the carved columns after which her grandfather&#x2019;s hall was called the Forest.<br><br>Figures were gathered in the light of the guttering firepit. Storied warriors, mail and weapons and ring-money gleaming with the colors of fire, their great shadows stretching out across the floor toward her.<br><br>Mother Kyre stood among them, and Skara&#x2019;s grandfather too, ill-fitting mail hastily dragged on, gray hair still wild from his bed. Smiling blandly upon his two prisoners was a slender warrior with a soft, handsome face, as careless as a child&#x2019;s, a space about him where even these other killers dared not tread.<br><br>Bright Yilling, who worshipped no god but Death.<br><br>His voice echoed jauntily in the vastness of the hall. &#x201c;I was hoping to pay my respects to Princess Skara.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She has gone to her cousin Laithlin,&#x201d; said Mother Kyre. The same voice that had calmly lectured, corrected, chastised Skara every day of her life, but with an unfamiliar warble of terror in it now. &#x201c;Where you will never reach her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, we will reach her there,&#x201d; said one of Yilling&#x2019;s warriors, a huge man with a neck like a bull&#x2019;s.<br><br>&#x201c;Soon enough, Mother Kyre, soon enough,&#x201d; said another with a tall spear and a horn at his belt.<br><br>&#x201c;King Uthil will come,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He will burn your ships and drive you back into the sea.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How will he burn my ships when they are safe behind the great chains at Bail&#x2019;s Point?&#x201d; asked Yilling. &#x201c;The chains you gave me the key to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Grom-gil-Gorm will come,&#x201d; she said, but her voice had faded almost to a whisper.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope it will be so.&#x201d; Yilling reached out with both hands and ever so gently eased Mother Kyre&#x2019;s hair back over her shoulders. &#x201c;But he will come too late for you.&#x201d; He drew a sword, a great diamond in a golden claw for a pommel, mirror-steel flashing so bright in the darkness it left a white smear across Skara&#x2019;s sight.<br><br>&#x201c;Death waits for us all.&#x201d; King Fynn took a long breath through his nose, and proudly drew himself up. A glimpse of the man he used to be. He looked about the hall and, through the columns, caught Skara&#x2019;s eye, and it seemed to her he gave the slightest smile. Then he dropped to his knees. &#x201c;Today you kill a king.&#x201d;<br><br>Yilling shrugged. &#x201c;Kings and peasants. We all look the same to Death.&#x201d;<br><br>He stabbed Skara&#x2019;s grandfather where his neck met his shoulder, blade darting in to the hilt and back out, quick and deadly as lightning falls. King Fynn made only a dry squeak he died so fast, and toppled face forward into the firepit. Skara stood frozen, her breath held fast, her mind held fast.<br><br>Mother Kyre stared down at her master&#x2019;s corpse. &#x201c;Grandmother Wexen gave me her promise,&#x201d; she stammered out.<br><br>Pit pat, pit pat, the blood dripped from the point of Yilling&#x2019;s sword. &#x201c;Promises only bind the weak.&#x201d;<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Eating with the Chefs: Family meals from the world&#39;s most creative restaurants</h2><p>"<p>The award&#x2010;winning food photographer and founder of the cult favorite <i>Fool</i> magazine invites you to pull up a chair and join the intimate family meals at some of the world&#x2019;s finest restaurants, including Blue Hill at Stone Barns, Chez Panisse, Roberta&#x2019;s, wd&#x2010;50, Attica, Mugaritz, Maison Pic, Noma, Osteria Francescana, St. John, and The French Laundry.</p><p><i>Eating with the Chefs</i> features 200 photographs by Pers&#x2010;Anders Jorgensen and more than 50 home cooking recipes from restaurants handpicked for their unique staff meal traditions.</p><p>The book includes appetizers and main dishes, as well as desserts.

The NKVD officer carefully designed it. He measured my size with a stick, made lines on the forest floor, and told me to dig. He wanted to make sure I'd fit well inside."<br><br>In 1941 Janusz Bardach's death sentence was commuted to ten years' hard labor and he was sent to Kolyma&#x2015;the harshest, coldest, and most deadly prison in Joseph Stalin's labor camp system&#x2015;the Siberia of Siberias. The only English-language memoir since the fall of communism to chronicle the atrocities committed during the Stalinist regime, Bardach's gripping testimony explores the darkest corners of the human condition at the same time that it documents the tyranny of Stalin's reign, equal only to that of Hitler. With breathtaking immediacy, a riveting eye for detail, and a humanity that permeates the events and landscapes he describes, Bardach recounts the extraordinary story of this nearly inconceivable world.<br><br>The story begins with the Nazi occupation when Bardach, a young Polish Jew inspired by Soviet Communism, crosses the border of Poland to join the ranks of the Red Army. His ideals are quickly shattered when he is arrested, court-martialed, and sentenced to death. How Bardach survives an endless barrage of brutality&#x2015;from a near-fatal beating to the harsh conditions and slow starvation of the gulag existence&#x2015;is a testament to human endurance under the most oppressive circumstances. Besides being of great historical significance, Bardach's narrative is a celebration of life and a vital affirmation of what it means to be human.</p><p>In 1941, accidentally rolling a Soviet tank while fording a river was considered a death offense by the Red Army. Unfortunately for young Janusz Bardach, he committed just such an error; lucky for him that an old acquaintance from his hometown in Poland had enough rank and influence to commute the court-martial penalty from death to 10 years hard labor in Siberia. For the next four years, Bardach endured hellish conditions in various labor camps--first a logging camp, then a gold mine in the frozen north. Frigid temperatures, inadequate food and clothing combined with physical and spiritual malaise to bring prisoners first to the edge of despair and then to the brink of suicide. Bardach survived by turning his mind off, by refusing to remember happier times or to anticipate the future. He became, simply, a beast of burden, shuffling through the hours of his slavery until he could fall into the brief oblivion of sleep. <p> Ironically, it was a near brush with death that proved to be Bardach's salvation. After surviving an explosion, he was sent to a prison hospital where he managed to talk his way into a job as a medical assistant. There he gained both a new lease on life and a future profession. Released from his sentence early, in 1945, Bardach went on to become a surgeon. His memoir, <i>Man Is Wolf to Man</i>, is more than just an account of his sufferings in a Russian labor camp; it is also a meditation on the will to survive in the face of hopelessness, the occasional kindnesses of strangers in unexpected places, and above all, the struggle to remain human under the most inhumane conditions.</p>"An enthralling record of often dreadful experiences in what Solzhenitsyn has called 'the pole of cold and cruelty' of Stalin's labor camp system: a saga of human endurance."&#x2015;Robert Conquest<br><br>"An extraordinary story of human brutality, human kindness, and human ability to survive under the most inhuman conditions imaginable. It should demonstrate to anyone who still entertains illusions about Soviet Communism how closely it resembled Nazism."&#x2015;Richard Pipes<br><br>"Beneath the layers of history and the ideological divisions, <i>Man Is Wolf to Man</i> is a glorious testimony to the resilience of the human spirit and a celebration of the tragic improvisations which are sometimes required to save a human life. After several generations, J. Bardach has opened another window into the tragic world first explored by A. Koestler in <i>Darkness at Noon</i>. This is a worthy and affirmative book."&#x2015;James A. McPherson<br><br>"Being spellbound by Dr. Bardach's vivid and richly detailed recollections, you become a fellow companion of a Jewish youth from Poland in his head-spinning odyssey across eight time-zones eastward with the Kolyma gold mines as the final destination. Through Bardach's experiences, one understands the feelings of countless other victims of history who found themselves between a rock and a hard place, as the relentless and senseless forces drove them from the Nazi gas chambers into the killing fields of Communism."&#x2015;Vassily Aksyonov</p><h2>The Shipwrecked Mind: On Political Reaction</h2><p>We don&#x2019;t understand the reactionary mind. As a result, argues Mark Lilla in this timely book, the ideas and passions that shape today&#x2019;s political dramas are unintelligible to us. <br><br>The reactionary is anything but a conservative. He is as radical and modern a figure as the revolutionary, someone shipwrecked in&nbsp;the rapidly changing present, and suffering from nostalgia for an idealized past and an apocalyptic fear that history is rushing toward catastrophe. And like the revolutionary his political engagements are motivated by highly developed ideas. &nbsp;<br><br>Lilla begins with three twentieth-century philosophers&#x2014;Franz Rosenzweig, Eric Voegelin, and Leo Strauss&#x2014;who attributed the problems of modern society to a break in the history of ideas and promoted a return to earlier modes of thought. He then examines the enduring power of grand historical narratives of betrayal to shape political outlooks since the French Revolution, and shows how these narratives are employed in the writings of Europe&#x2019;s right-wing cultural pessimists and Maoist neocommunists, American theoconservatives fantasizing about the harmony of medieval Catholic society and radical Islamists seeking to restore a vanished Muslim caliphate. <br><br>The revolutionary spirit that inspired political movements across the world for two centuries may have died out. But the spirit of reaction that rose to meet it has survived and is proving just as formidable a historical force. We live in an age when the&nbsp;tragicomic nostalgia of Don Quixote for a lost golden age has been transformed into a potent and sometimes deadly weapon. Mark Lilla helps us to understand why.</p><p><b>Mark Lilla</b> is Professor of Humanities at Columbia.

At the heart of the problem is the construction by successive governments, working in the interests of elites, of the most unfree market system ever created. A system in which property, financial, physical and intellectual, is controlled by a tiny but enormously powerful rentier class.<br></p><p><br>There is a lie at the heart of global capitalism. Politicians, financiers and global bureaucrats claim to believe in free competitive markets, but have constructed the most unfree market system ever. It is corrupt because income<br>is channelled to the owners of property &#x2013; financial, physical and intellectual &#x2013; at the expense of society.<br><br>This book reveals how global capitalism is rigged in favour of rentiers to the detriment of all of us, especially the precariat. A plutocracy and elite enriches itself, not through production of goods and services, but through ownership of assets, including intellectual property, aided by subsidies,<br>tax breaks, debt mechanisms, revolving doors between politics and business,<br>and the privatisation of public services. Rentier capitalism is entrenched by the corruption of democracy, manipulated by the plutocracy and an elite-dominated media.<br><br>Meanwhile, wages stagnate as labour markets are transformed by outsourcing, automation and the on-demand economy, generating more rental income while expanding the precariat.<br><br><em>The Corruption of Capitalism</em> argues that rentier capitalism is fostering revolt, and concludes by outlining a new income distribution system that would achieve the extinction of the rentier while promoting sustainable growth.Guy Standing: Guy Standing is Research Professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, and is a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences.<br>He was previously Professor of Economic Security at the University of Bath and Professor of Labour Economics at Monash University in Australia, and was director of the Socio-Economic Security Programme of the International Labour Organization, in the United Nations.

It&#x2019;s an unsettling book that faces the urgent questions of our times and doesn&#x2019;t settle for easy answers. Yet the resilience of the characters, the mature decision to avoid melodrama, gives us a novel full of hope and wonder, tied to fully realized characters that as readers, we come to care about. I loved this book.

This new adaptation of Butler's multi-volume <i>Lives of the Saints</i> presents a modernized text for today's reader and provides an illuminating guide to these historic, symbolic, and foundational Christian men and women. <br><br> Butler's daily readings from the lives and works of the saints offer readers of all backgrounds the opportunity to engage directly with these great figures. Butler's distinctive contribution to stories about saints was to turn attention away from the superhuman, miraculous themes that are prevalent in earlier works. He gives us saints who are examples of Christian living, who provide inspiration for our own lives, in every time and circumstance. As Butler writes: "They were once what we are now, travelers on earth. They had the same weaknesses we have. We have difficulties; so had the saints." <br><br> Important features of this version include mention of recently canonized saints as well as those whose path to official sainthood is still in progress. Also included in the daily readings are more obscure saints whose lives and contributions to Christianity should not be forgotten.</p><p>Bernard Bangley has authored and edited numerous books, including Radiance: A Spiritual Memoir of Evelyn Underhill, Talks on the Song of Songs by Bernard of Clairvaux, and Nearer to the Heart of God: Daily Readings with the Christian Mystics.

In fact, he's&nbsp;&nbsp;something of a pain in the brass: unkempt and unruly,&nbsp;&nbsp;with a taste for crude humor and a tendency to cut&nbsp;&nbsp;corners. They'd like nothing better than to bounce&nbsp;&nbsp;him from the department. The only problem is,&nbsp;&nbsp;Frost's the one D.I. who, by hook&nbsp;&nbsp;or by crook, always seems to find a way to get the&nbsp;&nbsp;job done.

Denton Division&nbsp;&nbsp;is shorthanded after a car crash involving several&nbsp;&nbsp;tipsy high-ranking cops, and on Guy Fawkes night&nbsp;&nbsp;there's more mischief abroad than just a few&nbsp;&nbsp;children making the rounds begging for pennies and&nbsp;&nbsp;lighting firecrackers. In the next few days, Frost will&nbsp;&nbsp;deal with a parade of miscreants, including a&nbsp;&nbsp;blackmailer, a shifty businessman, a not-so-greiving&nbsp;&nbsp;widow, a sexual pervert or two, a crazed housewife,&nbsp;&nbsp;and a cold-blooded kidnapper.

He believes that they deny the existence of truth and substitute radically chic theorizing for real knowledge about the past. The result is revolutionary and unprecedented: contemporary historians are increasingly obscuring the facts on which truth about the past is built. In The Killing of History, Windschuttle offers a devastating expose of these developments. This fascinating narrative leads us into a series of case histories that demonstrate how radical theory has attempted to replace the learning of traditional history with its own political agenda.</p><p>Australian scholar Keith Windschuttle is one of the fieriest participants in the debate about the practice of history. In <i>The Killing of History</i> he decries the growth of so-called cultural studies in place of the old-fashioned facts-and-chronologies approach. Windschuttle's passion sometimes carries him a bit too far, but he lands many solid punches, such as when he takes on the heavily published French scholar Michel de Certeau, who has called writing a tool of the power elite. "For someone who thinks writing is a form of oppression," Windschuttle twits, "he has done a lot of writing." Elsewhere Windschuttle attacks efforts to explain away such matters as human sacrifice among the Aztecs, saying that to accept such behavior is akin to "accepting the cultures of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia as equal but different."Keith Windschuttle has been a lecturer in history, social policy, sociology, and media studies at a number of Australian academic institutions.

Bennett Stewart, III, raises and answers these provocative questions:</p><p></p><ul><li>Do dividends matter?</li><li>Are earnings per share really accurate measures of corporate performance?</li><li>What is the engine that really drives share prices?</li></ul><p></p><p>More than that, Stewart lays the foundation for EVAr, the financial management and incentive system now in place at nearly 300 companies around the world, and which is rapidly becoming the global standard for corporate governance.</p><p>Managers, confused about what investors really want, often find it difficult to reach informed decisions regarding business strategy, acquisitions and divestitures, financial structure, dividend policy, and executive compensation. But now an EVAr -based revolution is providing a practical framework that managers can use to build a premium-valued company. At the forefront of this revolution is the consulting firm of Stern Stewart &amp; Co., of which G. Bennett Stewart, III, author of <em>The Quest for Value</em>, is senior partner and cofounder.</p><p><em>The Quest for Value</em> is written for senior management, key operating people, and planning and financial staff. This bible of financial management will assist managers in goal setting, resource allocation, strategy development, valuation of acquisitions, financial policy setting, incentive compensation planning, and building shareholder value.</p><p><em>The Quest for Value</em> cuts sharply through the myths that to this day misinform corporate strategists in their pursuit of shareholder value. Laying waste to inaccurate yet widely used methods of performance, Stewart demonstrates how the Stern Stewart EVAr approach not only creates greater shareholder value but also provides a powerful framework for the broadest range of corporate decision making.</p></p><p>G. Bennett Stewart, III, is a senior partner of Stern Stewart &amp; Co. Before co-founding Stern Stewart in 1982 with Joel Stern, he was a vice president of the financial advisory arm of the Chase Manhattan Bank. The EVA� management framework was developed by Mr. Stewart and his colleagues based on years of experience advising corporate clients on valuations, restructurings/recapitalizations, acquisitions and divestitures, and management incentive compensation plans. He is a principal speaker at Stern Stewart's EVA� seminars, and also serves as an executive editor of the firm's quarterly publication, <i>The Journal of Applied Corporate Finance.</i> Mr. Stewart has a M.B.A. from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University."Bennett Stewart's book is a notable example of what we at Chicago have always believed: Nothing is more practical than good theory. His neatly chosen, real-world illustrations bring the basic concepts of finance vividly to life. The book can be read with profit (and enjoyment) by anyone with an interest in corporate finance, from beginning student to senior executive."-- Merton H. Miller, Robert R. McCormick Distinguished Service Professor, Graduate School of Business, The University of Chicago, 1990 Nobel Prize winner""The Quest for Value" is the definitive handbook on how to enhance shareholder value. It provides senior managers with practical goals and guidelines to create value for their shareholders and for themselves." -- James J. Schiro, vice chairman, Price Waterhouse"Bennett Stewart challenges corporate management to focus on its principal mission of increasing shareholder wealth and shows how to do it. We are in the process of implementing a number of his recommendations for executive incentives."-- William W. McCarten, senior vice president, finance, corporate controller, Marriott Corporation""The Quest for Value" is an excellent work for the corporate strategist. It presents new, leading-edge planning paradigms in a practical, user-friendly way. Stewart's plan to restructure from within is of utmost importance to top management. It is my belief that companies may well come to be structured in the manner he prescribes, by necessity if not by choice."-- George J. Kirk, director, corporate strategy, corporate development, Westinghouse Electric Corporation"After more than forty experiences over ten years, we firmly believe that corporations that are owned by their managementand their board and are prudently leveraged will produce superior investment returns. In this excellent work, Bennett Stewart skillfully explains why."-- Carl Ferenbach, general partner, Berkshire Partners""The Quest for Value" is a stimulating and insightful presentation of financial issues facing every CEO in the 1990s." -- J.

But love got in the way...<br><br>Joan Johnston sweeps you back to Regency era England and Scotland with a love story that will take your breath away. Here is romance at its best as Johnston brings back unforgettable characters from her bestsellers <b>Captive</b>, <b>After the Kiss</b>, and <b>The Bodyguard</b> in a spellbinding novel of seduction and betrayal.<br><br>She was the reigning belle of the <i>ton</i> for the fourth Season in a row, but Lady Regina Wharton, the Duke of Blackthorne's daughter, was determined to avoid the perils of marriage. She had already seen enough to distrust all men. Then Clay Bannister, the dashing Earl of Carlisle, dared to steal a kiss and stir new and exciting desires.<br><br>Scarred by tragedy, Carlisle intrigued her with his mysterious past and his dark, dangerous charm. She never suspected she was about to marry her father's most vengeful enemy&#x2014;or that her greatest defense would be the passions he could not resist....</p><p>Award-winning author Joan Johnston concludes her Captive Hearts series with another winner, <i>The Bridegroom</i>. Wrongfully accused and deported to an Australian penal colony, Clay Bannister, Earl of Carlisle, vows revenge on the men responsible for his suffering: Cedric Ambleside, who framed him, and Alastair Wharton, the Duke of Blackthorne, who believed the trumped-up evidence and had Carlisle charged. After escaping the convict ship and making his fortune at sea, Carlisle returns to Regency London 11 years later to find his name cleared by Blackthorne, the same man who accused him. However, even the return of his title and his estates in England and Scotland cannot make Carlisle forget the loss of his wife and unborn son during his imprisonment--or the men who put him in prison. Unable to relinquish the darkness of his past, Carlisle woos Blackthorne's beautiful, headstrong daughter Regina, then presses her into marriage with the intent of abandoning her once she produces an heir. But the recalcitrant Reggie has in mind something else entirely. Carlisle finds his revenge difficult to exact when the instrument of that vengeance, his lovely new wife, refuses to cooperate. Reggie is determined that she will have both a loving husband and her father in her life, even if it kills her. And it might. Cedric Ambleside, embittered and hunted, will stop at nothing to keep Carlisle from finding him, even if it means murdering Reggie and once again framing Carlisle for the crime. As the threats to Reggie's well-being mount, Carlisle finds himself unable to contemplate his life without her, but it may be too late. <i>--Alison Trinkle</i>"A guaranteed good read."<br>--Heather Graham, <b>New York Times</b> bestselling author<br><br>"Johnston warms your heart and tickles your fancy."<br>--<b>Daily News</b> (New York)<br><br>"Joan Johnston continually gives us everything we want...fabulous details and atmosphere, memorable characters, a story that you wish would never end, and lots of tension and sensuality."<br>--<b>Romantic Times</b></p><h2>Nova Swing: A Novel (Kefahuchi Tract)</h2><p>Set in the unique world first featured in the award-winning <b>Light,</b> here is a story of love, murder, and intergalactic noir on the razor� s edge of the imagination, as envisioned by the incomparable M.

John Harrison</strong> </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> You've returned to the same setting as <i>Light</i> with <i>Nova Swing</i>, but <i>Nova Swing</i> isn't really a sequel, right? </p><p> <strong>Harrison:</strong> It's a kind of companion piece. It's less sprawling than <i>Light</i>. It could be read independently but there's some interplay, which you would miss if you hadn't read the other book. I wanted to revisit the genetically-modified servants and entertainers--the prostitutes, gladiators, rickshaw girls, and gun-kiddies--and show them as more human than some of the human beings. A key element I wanted to extend from the first book was the idea of human behaviour as code, further undermining conventional ideas we have of personality, character, and consciousness. I liked the idea of a kind of life based on complex algorithms which can run themselves on any platform. The Kefahuchi Code is imagined as preceding physics in some way. Reality is just another substrate it can run on. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> If a reader came up to you and asked you what <i>Nova Swing</i> was about, what would you say? </p><p> <strong>Harrison:</strong> It's about being a meme and not knowing it. The set-up is this: we are on one of the Beach planets. A generation--perhaps two--after Ed Chianese took his ship The Black Cat off the Beach and into the Kefahuchi Tract, part of the Tract has fallen to earth in a city called Saudade. It's a zone of the unreliable. It's infected with K-code: or maybe it is K-code, the wrong physics loose in the universe. Everyone is drawn to the "event site" like moths to a flame, from failed entradista Vic Serotonin to middle class tourist Elizabeth Keilar; from Vic's friend Pauli DeRaad, ex vacuum commando and all-round Earth Military Contracts factotum, to Lens Aschemann the dissociated police detective. They're all looking for something their lives don't show them. But for everyone who goes in, something new and weird is coming out... </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> You've written novels with contemporary settings, novels that mix the contemporary and SF, like <i>Light</i>, and then something like <i>Nova Swing</i>, which is all set in the future. What is it that attracts you to the SF element? </p><p> <strong>Harrison:</strong> SF is an opportunity to have an intense relationship with your own imagination. It's a kind of drive-by poetry, trashy and addictive; it's fun. After that, for me, it's an opportunity to explore that kind of imaginative artifact from inside, and use a little camped-up contemporary science as a way of generating new metaphors around my typical obsessions. While I agree with almost everything that Geoff Ryman and the Mundanes say about SF, I can't join them because I find it impossible to assign different levels of plausibility to acts of the imagination. If you limit yourself on the grounds that faster-than-light travel isn't "realistic," you might as well go whole hog and write only fiction set on the street where you live; if you limit yourself to that, you might as well go whole hog and write nothing but nonfiction; if you limit yourself to that, you might as well go whole hog, admit that writing is not the real world--and can't even successfully represent the real world--and give it up altogether. I'd be happy to do that, and indeed I've already done all of those things more than once in the last 40 years. But if you're going to write SF in the first place, why not lie back, admit it's a farrago, and enjoy it? I think there's a great deal to be gained from revaluing and enjoying the distinction between the invented and the real. As long as you maintain that, SF's a great genre. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> When you start a new novel, is it easier every time because you've got more experience each time? </p><p> <strong>Harrison:</strong> If you were trying to solve the same problems every time, I think it would get easier. But if you can maintain a complex relationship with who you are, and always let form show you what you could say (rather than going the rationalist route of selecting a form that fits the things you already expect to be saying), the next book will always be a challenge. Whatever you do, it's hard to escape your typical subject matter and obsessions. The main thing is to look for situations in which you can make bad decisions, otherwise you're writing from a template. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> You read and review a lot of novels for English media. What's most disappointed you and/or most surprised you in a good way recently? </p><p> <strong>Harrison:</strong> I didn't enjoy <i>House of Meetings</i>. I thought Amis's need to add literary value obscured the human facts of the Gulag. By the opposite token, Dave Eggers's <i>What Is the What</i> is one of the most powerful and affecting books I've read, precisely because he doesn't let his own needs and abilities overshadow the work the book is doing. Though I was a bit sniffy with it in the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>, I really rather enjoyed my encounter with <i>The Dictator and the Hammock</i>, by Daniel Pennac. Pennac is as intrusive an author as Amis, but that's part of the contract: you don't read him, you have a lively argument with him then lose your temper because he was gaming you all along. Someone else who is gaming you, in a different way, is Chuck Palahniuk. I adored <i>Rant</i>, though I found its voice a bit overpowering by the end. Apart from the Eggers, the books I've liked most recently haven't been books I've reviewed: Ali Smith, <i>The Accidental</i>; Houellebecq's <i>Atomised</i> [<i>The Elementary Particles</i> in the US]; <i>The Mistress's Daughter</i> by A.M. Homes. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> What projects are you working on now? </p><p> <strong>Harrison:</strong> I'm writing a collection of short stories. I'm foraging about in the set-up for the next novel, trying to set enough limits for it to be writeable. I've been blogging at Uncle Zip's Window. (That turned out to be a project in itself.) I recently wrote some stories for Barbara Campbell's web-based durational performance 1001 Nights Cast; and, along with Tim Etchells, Deborah Levi, Jo Randerson, and Richard Maxwell, generated text for a performance by Kate McIntosh (Loose Promise), which premieres in Berlin later this year. The 1001 Nights rules encourage you to write quickly, relinquish control of the product, give up the obsessive write/rewrite cycle. Challenging for someone like me. </p>M.

Sure, you have heard of diabetes before and may even have a general idea of what led to this diagnosis--maybe you have family members with diabetes or have been fighting your weight and a sweet tooth unsuccessfully for years. Or perhaps you've just been living a sedentary lifestyle. In fact, your doctor may have even warned you that in most cases, developing the disease is a direct result of poor nutrition and lack of exercise. But you didn't really listen, because you've been living this way for years and things seemed fine. How did you miss the warning signs? And what exactly went wrong? To find the answer, we need to go back to the basics and look deep inside your body at its building blocks: your cells.<br><br>Diabetes and Inflammation<br><br>Contrary to popular belief, diabetes is not just the result of having high blood sugar and an insulin-deficient pancreas. Instead, it is a chronic state of widespread inflammation--a direct result of your body not being used to its original design. We have ancient bodies and ancient souls, and in these modern times, we don't use them in the way in which they were intended. The little-acknowledged truth is that our bodies are made for outdoor living (i.e., hunting and gathering), not for sitting in a cubicle day in and day out, eating fabricated "food," and watching TV until late in the night. Did you ever think that this kind of lifestyle hurts your body-- and that it deprives you of productivity, creativity, and happiness?<br><br>Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes<br><br>There are several risk factors linked to the development of diabetes. Take a look at the list below to determine how many apply to you.<br><br>� Family history. Both your genes and your childhood environment (learned eating habits, outdoor activities, sleeping patterns, reward mechanisms, etc.) can increase or decrease your risk of developing diabetes.<br><br>�&nbsp;Weight and fat distribution. The more fat you have (especially around your middle), the more resistant your body becomes to insulin and the hunger-regulating hormone leptin.<br><br>�&nbsp;Sedentary lifestyle. Prolonged periods of sitting increase your chances of developing diabetes. Why? Working your muscles squelches the fire of inflammation. Not using your muscles leads to the development of diabetes. And when you sit, you barely use any muscles.<br><br>�&nbsp;Race. Certain races are more prone to the ravishments of the Western diet than others: Hispanics, blacks, Hawaiians, Native Americans, and Asians have an increased risk of developing diabetes.<br><br>�&nbsp;Age. Beginning at age 45, your risk for diabetes grows considerably. At this time in your life, you have likely eaten too many cupcakes with icing and walked too few miles--and the effects of this lifestyle are beginning to show. And retirees have an even higher risk of developing diabetes because they can easily fall prey to the damages of a sedentary lifestyle.<br><br>�&nbsp;Gestational diabetes. Diabetes during pregnancy is like an early warning shot: You have the genes, and if you are not careful with what you eat and how you live, you will eventually develop diabetes.<br><br>�&nbsp;Giving birth to a large baby. Having a baby who weighs more than 9 �ds puts you at risk for developing diabetes later in life.<br><br>�&nbsp;Prediabetes. When your hemoglobin A1c hovers close to 6.0, consider yourself at risk.<br><br>�&nbsp;An overweight peer group. People have a tendency to adopt the lifestyle habits of those closest to them, including family members, friends, and co- workers.<br><br>�&nbsp;Hypothyroidism. An elevated TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level and/or antibodies against thyroid tissue are often found in patients with diabetes. And many have gluten intolerance. Be sure your doctor addresses all of these problems.<br><br>�&nbsp;Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). This syndrome manifests itself more in your ovaries and your skin, but it still has many features of diabetes. And the treatment is also the same: improved lifestyle.<br><br>�&nbsp;High blood pressure. This is part of the metabolic syndrome (overweight, hypertension, high lipids, and insulin resistance), so having one of them sets you up for developing the rest.<br><br>�&nbsp;A history of stroke. If you've experienced a stroke, your odds of developing diabetes automatically increase.<br><br>�&nbsp;Acanthosis nigricans. This is a skin condition in which skin located under the armpits and in folds of the body is dark, thicker, and velvety.<br><br>�&nbsp;Gluten intolerance. Those who are gluten intolerant are at an increased risk of developing diabetes as well.<br><br>�&nbsp;Poor sleeping habits. Lack of sleep promotes weight gain and obesity.<br><br>You may wonder how so many different things go haywire in a diabetic's body, all seemingly unconnected, like high blood pressure, arthritis, and cancer. What is the unifying process underlying all of those divergent diseases? It is inflammation. And a January 2013 meta-analysis of 10 studies with more than 19,000 participants showed that raised levels of inflammation markers were significantly associated with an increased risk of having type 2 diabetes.1 Included in this meta-analysis was a 2001 study published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i> showing that the levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein (two of the major markers of inflammation) were considerably higher in women who subsequently developed diabetes.2 Researchers found that women with higher baseline levels of interleukin-6 were at 7.5 times greater risk of becoming diabetic than those with the lowest levels of inflammation. Furthermore, women with higher levels of C-reactive protein were at 15.7 times greater risk of developing diabetes. After adjusting their findings for known risk factors, the researchers reported that the women with the highest levels of interleukin-6 were 2.3 times more likely to become diabetics, while those with highest levels of C-reactive protein were 4.2 times more likely to develop diabetes.<br><br>But where does all of the inflammation come from? This widespread and sneaky inflammation stems from an accumulation of fat and waste debris in and around every cell in your body that affects every single organ in your body. It also prevents your mitochondria (those specialized subunits in all of your cells that produce energy like little batteries) from generating the energy you need. Mitochondria are intimately involved in the insulin secretion process and are affected negatively by a too-nutritious (or high- calorie) diet. As a result, your damaged mitochondria hinder proper insulin secretion, which leads to the development of diabetes.3 And sooner or later, the breakdown of your mitochondria will cause all kinds of other diseases as well, including heart disease, stroke, and even cancer.<br><br>How you choose to live your life either increases or decreases the inflammation in your body. Every day--every moment--you are making a decision to either put out the fire of inflammation or stoke it.<br><br>Inflammation: Acute versus Chronic<br><br>Have you ever had an area on your body that's painful, red, swollen, and hot? These are the classic four cardinal signs of inflammation, established by the Roman physician Celsus (circa 25 BC to 50). And in the second century AD, Galen (129 AD to circa 200 AD) added a fifth: penuria, which means loss of function.<br><br>In an acute infection, such as a bee sting, an infected tooth, or an acutely inflamed knee, all five signs are often there. In chronic inflammation, those signs may be harder to spot, mainly because the inflammatory process takes place inside your body and is, therefore, less visible. But even though you can't see it, this chronic inflammation is causing insidious damage inside your body.<br><br>What Role Does Genetics Play?<br><br>Many people blame their diabetes on their genes: "I just have bad genes. After all, my mother and my grandmother had diabetes, too."<br><br>On one level they are right: You can weigh 300 pounds and as long as you don't have a genetic predisposition, you will never develop diabetes. Genes and their DNA carry the blueprint for everything that we have inherited and everything that makes up our bodies. Certain genes can increase your risk of developing diabetes, while other genes can cause you to gain weight more easily than other people.<br><br>Your genome--the strand of DNA in each cell that carries all your genes and some junk DNA, the non-gene "empty" areas between genes--is so well packed that in each cell, only the parts that are urgently needed are exposed to the surface. The rest is tucked away. (In a liver cell, for example, everything that pertains to your heart or your hair color is stowed away and only the liver genes are exposed.)<br><br>What we are learning is that, on one level, the junk DNA and the packaging is even more important than the original strand of DNA. And this packaging (called epigenetics) is influenced by lifestyle factors, such as what you eat (and even what your mother ate), how often you exercise, and how much you sleep.4 So, in a way, you are responsible for your own genes because you can influence them--to a certain degree. Further, some scientists think that your lifestyle influences most of your total health outcome, including your epigenetic packaging, especially if your mother and your grandmother had diabetes!5 So while you may not be able to change your genes, you can change your lifestyle and, subsequently, your epigenetics. And you can even hand these epigenetic changes down to your children and grandchildren.<br><br>Once you are told that having chronic inflammation in your body leads to the development of numerous health problems such as diabetes, you may naturally want to expel all inflammation from your body. After all, if it causes diabetes, it is as desirable as a case of head lice or bedbugs. But as hot and raging as inflammation is, it is also an extremely useful tool in your body. Without it, nothing could heal in your body--not even a simple scratch. You're already aware of the inflammation that occurs from infection (when white blood cells and cascades of chemical processes rid your body of intruders such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi). But infection is only one example of inflammation.<br><br>Triggers of Inflammation<br><br>Below is a list of the wide range of triggers that can incite the white blood cell response and the cascade of chemical processes of inflammation.<br><br>�&nbsp;Alcohol<br>�&nbsp;Allergens<br>�&nbsp;Artificial colors and flavors<br>�&nbsp;Bacteria<br>�&nbsp;Burns<br>�&nbsp;Chemicals<br>�&nbsp;Dairy<br>�&nbsp;Dirt<br>�&nbsp;Drugs<br>�&nbsp;Exercise: Both too much and too little can be harmful.<br>�&nbsp;Fats: Certain dietary fats heal, while others cause harm.<br>�&nbsp;Frostbite<br>�&nbsp;Fungi<br>�&nbsp;Herbicides<br>�&nbsp;Insulin: Although we need insulin to process dietary sugars, too much insulin damages your cells.<br>�&nbsp;Molds<br>�&nbsp;Molecules: Certain molecules are foreign to your body, such as some modern drugs and food additives.<br>�&nbsp;Obesity<br>�&nbsp;Parasites<br>�&nbsp;Pesticides<br>�&nbsp;Pollutants<br>�&nbsp;Preservatives: Man-made preservatives are often damaging, whereas plant- derived preservatives like curry, which is used in India to preserve food, are beneficial in lower doses. Often, they are antioxidants.<br>�&nbsp;Radiation<br>�&nbsp;Rancid foods<br>�&nbsp;Skin irritants<br>�&nbsp;Sleep: Not getting enough sleep is harmful to our bodies on many levels.<br>�&nbsp;Stress: There is good stress and bad stress. Take the example of antioxidants, which are not just superbly beneficial com�ds. Plants manufacture antioxidants when germs and insects nibble on their leaves. These antioxidants act as weapons against invaders and kill unwanted pests. When we consume small amounts of antioxidants in our food, our bodies send small stress signals to fight off the com�ds. These stress signals stimulate our immune systems and cause them to function at a better rate. But in larger doses, antioxidants can cause us harm as well. So good stress comes from things like cold showers, limited exposure to antioxidants, and small amounts of exercise, while bad stress results from too little sleep, too much exercise (or none at all), unlimited exposure to antioxidants, and bland, processed foods.<br>�&nbsp;Sugars, especially HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup)<br>�&nbsp;Sunlight: Finding the right balance of exposure to natural sunlight is important--both getting too much and getting too little can be harmful.<br>�&nbsp;Toxins<br>�&nbsp;Trauma<br>�&nbsp;Viruses<br>�&nbsp;Wounds<br><br>Inflammation protects you from germs, foreign bodies, and a host of other dangers, and it is the reason that a cut will heal in a timely manner. But imagine if this hot and raging swelling takes place in your joints, your heart, your brain, your kidneys, and your liver. It's invisible to you because this kind of inflammation only occurs deep inside your body where it can't be seen. You can feel it, though, in all those aches, pains, and discomforts you experience. They are signals that something is wrong and inflamed, even if your doctor can't find a fitting diagnosis. And this ongoing, chronic inflammation is the kind that you don't want to have smoldering in your body.<br><br>How Inflammation Works<br><br>To explain how inflammation works, let's look at an example of acute inflammation. When a splinter lodges in your finger, your body immediately begins to build a wall of inflammation around it by attracting white blood cells to the site of the splinter. The white blood cells gobble up the germs and toxins that otherwise would spread throughout your entire body. Once the white blood cells are filled with toxins, they die. And this mass of dead cells is called pus. Next, your skin breaks and the splinter is expelled from your finger, along with the pus. Then the tissue closes and your skin heals over.<br><br>Sounds straightforward, right? Well, it's actually a bit more complicated than that. For inflammation to work, an intricate dance between blood cells and plasma proteins (also known as mediator chemicals) has to ensue. If germs invade your body and your body cannot mount an inflammatory defense, you will die.<br><br>An intruding germ carries chemicals on its surface that the body recognizes as foreign. And defense starts immediately: These invaders attract the two prongs of inflammation--cells and biochemicals--that trigger the intricate cascade of recognizing the invader, mounting the forces, attacking, ingesting, destroying, and cleaning up. Then the healing begins.<br><br>First, the blood vessels around the pathogens dilate to bring more blood to the site, and arriving with the blood are white blood cells (the defenders) and mediator chemicals (the messengers). The enlarged vessels seep plasma (the watery part of blood) into the surrounding areas until only the white blood cells are left, packed tightly in the capillaries. Now you have a swollen wall around the germs. The mediator chemicals have numerous supportive functions such as attracting more white blood cells, dilating the vessels even more, producing heat so that germs are killed, and stimulating the nerve endings susceptible to pain. Feeling pain is important for two reasons: to call attention to the fact that something is wrong and to remind you to keep the affected body part still. If you didn't feel pain, you would go on with your busy life and your body would have a harder time healing.</p><h2>Cold Steel (The Spiritwalker Trilogy, 3)</h2><p>The fantastic conclusion to the Spiritwalker trilogy!<br>Trouble, treachery, and magic just won't stop plaguing Cat Barahal.

All she needs is to pull off the responsibilities of lead costumer for the summer production of Grease at the local playhouse and secure a recommendation for her portfolio.

Contemplation on his proverbs and principles will deliver the serenity of a much less chaotic time to your life and family. It is a vintage treasure that keeps our Christian heritage alive and unrevised for every family, leader, and library.William Penn (1644-1718) is best known as a bold and principled founder of the city of Philadelphia. Having experienced religious persecution because of his staunch Quaker beliefs, he diligently planned for a place where tolerance and civility would define the governance of the people. Given extensive lands in the New World by royal order, which encompassed the state of Pennsylvania, he worked hard to promote the principles of democracy. Many would serve as inspiration for the future Constitution of the United States of America. Though a brilliant scholar and generous man, Penn&#39;s refusal to allow Pennsylvania to be stripped of these values in order to sell it, meant he would eventually die penniless and was buried in an unmarked grave.</p><h2>Feminine Sexuality: Jacques Lacan and the �cole freudienne</h2><p><p><strong>Jacques Lacan is arguably the most controversial psychoanalyst of our time.</strong></p> Psychoanalysis is certainly one of the most contested areas of debate within feminism. This book presents articles on feminine sexuality by Lacan and members of the <em>�cole freudienne</em>, the school of psychoanalysis that Lacan directed in Paris from 1964 to 1980.<br><br> The question of feminine sexuality has divided the psychoanalytic movement since the 1920s. Despite their opposition to each other, contemporary psychoanalysis and feminism both reject Freud's phallocentrism. This book forcefully reasserts the importance of the castration complex in Freud's work and of the phallus in the work of Lacan, offering them not as a reflection of a theory based on male supremacy and privilege but as the terms through which any such privilege is exposed as a fraud. Lacan's rereading of Freud is seen here to reveal, in a way that no other account has been able to do, the arbitrary and fictional nature of both male and female sexual identity and, specifically, the fantasy behind the category "woman" as the dominant fetish of our culture. These texts reveal that women constantly exceed the barriers of the definition to which they are confined.</p><p><p>The psychoanalyst <strong>Jacques Lacan</strong> (1901-1981) was one of the twentieth century's most influential thinkers.

Professor Fink explains his ideas and demonstrates his innovative developmental exercises that set the pianist free to express the most profound musical ideas. HARDCOVER.</p><p>Professor Seymour Fink, retired senior piano professor in the Department of Music, University of New York at Binghamton, has made a lifetime study of piano technique and its pedagogy. An active solo and chamber pianist, Professor Fink gives numerous master classes and lecture demonstrations on piano teaching and technical development. He brings to this study a wealth of European and American educational experience, worldwide travel and observation of the pianistic scene, and more than 35 years of piano teaching experience.En Excerpt From <p>Mastering Piano Technique: A Guide for Students, Teachers, and Performers </p><p>By Seymour Fink </p><p>Piano technique is more than the physical ability to render the printed page of music accurately; it is the vehicle for interpretation, the key to musical expression. Movement and meaning are so closely related to each other that the specific character of the gesture is itself part of the message conveyed. For example, musical continuity demands physical continuity, it being virtually impossible to express a quiet, flowing line with either constricted or overly energetic movement. Likewise, rhythmic vitality can be articulated only through vigorous action. Technical decisions are thus never made in an artistic vacuum. But having said this, I must also add that there is no single correct way to play. Good technical training encourages exploration of a variety of approaches for, by encouraging flexibility, efficiency, and surety -- whatever the artistic purpose, performers become freer to follow their imaginations. In short, when pianists are confident in their ability to create!<br> something extraordinarily beautiful at the keyboard, they dare to try. And only by trying can they succeed. </p><p>Technique is like grammar; once it is a part of you, you speak without conscious attention to it. In the same way, technical matters function below the conscious level in mature pianists. Experimenting first one way then another, pianists mine their deepest, most intuitive feelings about the music, seeking out a particular mood, tone color, or expressive nuance. Ultimately their inner musical thinking triggers the requisite movement so they experience no separation between muscular exertions and musical goals. </p><p>The circumstances of the novice differ radically from those of the seasoned player; consistent technical training must be made an integral part of the learning experience. When first coming to grips with the relatively awkward conditions surrounding purposeful movement at the keyboard, students should be instructed in a healthy and efficient use of their bodies. Poor technical training slows their rate of progress and inevitably limits pianistic growth. Clearly, pianists and piano teachers can profit from a graphic, practical, and comprehensive treatment of the biomechanics and pedagogy of piano technique, its means and ends, presented in a cogent, organized manner.</p></p><h2>Banana Bottom (Harvest Book, Hb 273)</h2><p>A Jamaican girl, Bita Plant, who was adopted and sent to be educated in England by white missionary benefactors, returns to her native village of Banana Bottom and finds her black heritage at war with her newly acquired culture.<br></p><p>Claude McKay (September 15, 1889&nbsp;- May 22, 1948) was a Jamaican writer and poet.

When the glittering treasure of ancient Garamantia, the golden child, is delivered to the museum, a web of intrigue tightens around its personnel, especially the hapless museum officer Waring Smith. While prowling the halls one night, Waring is nearly strangled. Two suspicious deaths ensue, and only the cryptic hieroglyphics of the Garamantes can bring an end to the mayhem. Fitzgerald has an unerring eye for human nature, and this satirical look at the art world delivers a terrifically witty read.</p><p>Penelope Fitzgerald's first novel is packed with institutional follies and fiercely territorial old trouts. Set in a London museum whose officers only appear august, <i>The Golden Child</i> literally proves that authorities are clowns and clowns authorities. As the book opens, all England is queuing up to see the golden treasure of the Garamantes--the remains of a young king who was interred complete with a trove of toys and goodies. Only the man who unearthed the kinglet back in 1913 refuses to go anywhere near the exhibit, despite his constant proximity: "Sir William, in extreme but clear-headed old age, and after a lifetime of fieldwork, had come to roost in the Museum itself." Meanwhile, everyone--from nations to corporations--wants a piece of the Golden Child. (The exhibit is even underwritten by a company that hopes its puff, "Silence is Golden," will give its cigarettes more positive associations.) What, then, if the relics are cursed--or fake?<p> As both possibilities grow increasingly likely, and the Museum risks ridicule, its director deputizes Waring Smith to transport the mummy's doll to an incorruptible expert. Too bad if Professor Semyonov is in Russia: this junior officer will simply have to smuggle the toy in! Suffice it to say that Waring's covert odyssey to Moscow is but one of <i>The Golden Child</i>'s many witty--and enigmatic--episodes. Near the Kremlin, he comes upon a line that makes him think he's back at work. The citizens, though, have assembled for another mummy altogether: </p><blockquote>The park statues were covered with shrouds of straw to protect them against the cold, but the human beings stood there, wiping the frozen drops from noses and eyelashes, waiting with immemorial patience to see what they had been told was worth seeing. In an hour and a half they would be filing past the embalmed head and hands, and the ghastly evening dress suit, of Lenin. </blockquote> On the surface, Fitzgerald's 1977 novel is a bona fide mystery, complete with a body in the library and a spot of garroting. But adepts of this author will prize it for its pixilated cast of characters and for its gentle, perfect assaults on pretension--whether academic, journalistic, or even gustatory. As ever, Fitzgerald is drawn to explore the power--and sheer inconvenience--of the emotions. No wonder <i>The Golden Child</i>'s mysteries go so far beyond those of its genre. <i>--Kerry Fried</i>PENELOPE FITZGERALD wrote many books small in size but enormous in popular and critical acclaim over the past two decades.

The crime and the bungled FBI investigation left behind a web of mysteries. The most puzzling of all: what crime were the men enroute to commit when Officer Dale Claxton stopped them&#x2014;and paid for his bravery with his life?</p><p>Tony Hillerman assigns these real-life puzzles to his fictional Navajo Tribal police officers&#x2014;Sergeant Jim Chee and Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn (retired). The time is now, and the memory of the mishandled manhunt of 1998 is still painfully fresh when three men stage a pre-dawn raid on the Ute Tribe&#x2019;s gambling casino, and then disappear in the maze of canyons on the Utah-Arizona border after killing a policeman. Together, Chee and Leaphorn discover an intriguing pattern connecting this crime with the exploits of a legendary Ute hero/bandit. Tightly plotted and beautifully written, <em>Hunting Badger</em> proves once again that no one tells a story like Tony Hillerman.</p></p><p>The marvelous <i>Hunting Badger</i> is Tony Hillerman's 14th novel featuring Navajo tribal police officers Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee. Here the two cops (who appeared in separate books early on but whose paths now cross routinely) are working two angles of the same case to catch the right-wing militiamen who pulled off a violent heist at an Indian casino. Hillerman serves up plenty of action and enough plot twists to keep readers off balance, leading up to a satisfyingly tense climax in which Leaphorn and Chee stalk a killer in his hideout. But through it all, the cardinal Hillerman virtues are in evidence: economical, pellucid prose; a panoply of Indian-country characters who seem to rise right up off the page; vivid evocations of the Southwest's bleak beauty; and rich insights into Navajo life and culture. (Hillerman once told an interviewer that the highest compliment he'd ever received was many Navajo readers' assumption that he himself is Navajo--he's not.)<p> While first-time readers will find plenty to enjoy in <i>Hunting Badger</i>, it holds special pleasures for longtime fans. There's more and deeper contact between Leaphorn and Chee, and we continue to see further into the prickly Leaphorn's human side (though without fuss or sentimentality). Chee finally begins to get over Janet Pete (it took about six books) and inch toward a new love interest. And in a moving section involving Chee's spiritual teacher Frank Sam Nakai, the shaman provides a key insight into the case.</p><p> In a world teeming with "sense of place" mysteries--set in Seattle, Alaska, the Arizona desert, or Chicago--it can be a shock to return to Hillerman, who started it all, and realize just how superior he is to the rest of the pack. <i>--Nicholas H. Allison</i></p>Three armed men raid the Ute tribe's gambling casino, and then disappear in the maze of canyons on the Utah-Arizona border. The FBI takes over the investigation, and agents swarm in with helicopters and high-tech equipment. Making an explosive situation even hotter, these experts devise a theory of the crime that makes a wounded deputy sheriff a suspect -- a development that brings in Tribal Police Sergeant Jim Chee and his longtime colleague, retired Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn to help.<p>Chee finds a fatal flaw in the federal theory and Leaphorn sees an intriguing pattern connecting this crime with the exploits of a legendary Ute hero bandit. Balancing politics, outsiders, and missing armed fugitives, Leaphorn and Chee soon find themselves caught in the most perplexing -- and deadly -- crime hunt of their lives....</p></p><h2>German Stormtrooper 1914&#x2013;18 (Warrior)</h2><p>The first official German stormtroop unit was authorized on 2 March 1915 when the Supreme Command of the field army ordered the VIII Corps to form a detachment for the testing of experimental weapons and the development of approximate tactics that could break the deadlock on the Western Front. By the summer of 1915, stormtroop units were springing up throughout the German armies in the west, and by the end of 1916 official stormtroop battalions were established throughout the western armies, providing a deadly new threat for the Allies.

One of the most individual voices of his generation, Armitage revitalizes our sense of the <em>Odyssey</em> as oral poetry, as indeed one of the greatest of tall tales.</p><p>Simon Armitage is the award-winning poet and translator of both Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and The Death of King Arthur, as well as several works of poetry, prose, and drama. He is the Oxford Professor of Poetry.One of Britain's most successful poets, the versatile and clever Armitage follows up his translation of the medieval poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight with this engaging and compulsively readable adaptation of Homer's epic, in which the wily sailor-hero Odysseus must outplay, outwit or outlast seductive nymphs, a malevolent enchantress, a one-eyed giant, and his own impious crew in order to reach his home island, his son and his faithful wife. Written for BBC radio, Armitage's version is not a translation of the ancient Greek epic, but rather a dramatic rendering, divided into scenes with parts (mostly in verse) for voice actors. Armitage delivers fast paced and decidedly contemporary language: Odysseus himself envisions A freak wave cracking the keel of some poor sailing ship.... Just the Gods doing their thing. The transformation of a tale about one man into exchanges among sets of characters can make things seem choppy early on, but it pays off when Odysseus reaches home and has to maintain his disguise until he can slaughter his wife's suitors. Armitage's play will entertain, if not enlighten, anyone interested in the fresh ways that Homer's story can be told. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This time the Keepers have made it personal. And the Op-Center forces will strike with deadly vengeance...</p><p>A little more than thirty years ago <b>Tom Clancy</b> was a Maryland insurance broker with a passion for naval history. Years before, he had been an English major at Baltimore&#x2019;s Loyola College and had always dreamed of writing a novel. His first effort, <i>The Hunt for Red October</i>, sold briskly as a result of rave reviews, then catapulted onto the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list after President Reagan pronounced it &#x201c;the perfect yarn.&#x201d; From that day forward, Clancy established himself as an undisputed master at blending exceptional realism and authenticity, intricate plotting, and razor-sharp suspense. He passed away in October 2013.The Op-Center series, created by Clancy and television producer Pieczenik, contains a large cast of characters that runs the U.S. government's elite crisis management team. This sixth and latest installment twists three seemingly unrelated plots into an engrossing, albeit contrived, story. A multinational terrorist group called the Peacekeepers, comprised of former U.N. soldiers, plans an attack on the U.N. during a private Saturday-night party in the Security Council chambers. Meanwhile, an angry Cambodian couple seeks revenge for a murder committed long ago. And Paul Hood, the center's recently retired head, is trying to piece everything together, but his troubled personal life only hinders his job. As the story lines converge, readers are taken deep inside the heart of America's defense, intelligence and crisis management networks. Stilted dialogue and unfortunate stabs at sentimentality, however, diminish the overall suspense.

A Chinese immigrant to Jamaica in the 1890s, Lowe revels in the lush beauty of his adoptive land. But the past confronts Lowe in everything he does, and so his history reveals itself-the tale of his exile from China, his shipboard adventures, an unwanted pregnancy and the arrangement that was made to avoid scandal. The arrangement placed Lowe in a marriage of convenience with a mysterious widow, Miss Sylvie. Lowe and Sylvie's relationship is complex, vivid, erotic, and full of secrets. Sylvie is a light-skinned black woman who, in the course of their three decades together, gives up three dark-skinned children for adoption. But Lowe's secret is much more startling, and remarkable-Lowe is actually a woman who began cross-dressing to pass as a man because it was illegal for Chinese women to emigrate. This is the story of the destruction of a far-away world: the burning of Lowe's shop and the demolition of his masks; and the creation of a dream: the building of a pagoda where culture and the past are accepted and acceptable.<br></p><p><i>The Pagoda</i> is the kind of book that revolves around a Big Secret. Give it away, and suffer the wrath of readers everywhere; keep it, and find yourself muttering enigmatic inanities about "the fluidity of identity" and so on. This much, at least, is safe to explain: Chinese immigrant Lowe runs a small village shop in post-emancipation Jamaica. Caught between black villagers and white planters and threatened on both sides, Lowe leads a tenuous, guarded existence. He marries the light-skinned Miss Sylvie, becomes estranged from his adult daughter, Liz, and has a mysterious, complex relationship with his white benefactor, Cecil. Then, one night, someone from the village burns his shop to the ground, and soon the various masks Lowe has assumed for survival begin falling away. <p> Granted, by the time the Big Secret is revealed, readers have a pretty good idea of what it is--but there are others to take its place. In <i>The Pagoda</i> Patricia Powell creates a world thick with sex and secrets and tropical smells, in prose that is by turns lyrical and claustrophobic. "The secrets inside that glimmering white house and in that village had been so tightly hemmed in that sometime soon they'd all be choking," she writes, and the reader may sometimes feel the same way. Worse, it's hard to warm up to Lowe, a man so detached from his emotions and the people around him that for years he has lived as if "through some kind of veil." </p><p> But <i>The Pagoda</i> succeeds in another, more difficult task: dramatizing the fundamental ambivalence of human relations corrupted by power. Nothing is black and white in Powell's third novel, least of all the relationship between victim and victimizer, or between savior and torturer. Lowe ends up forgiving even the man who burns down his shop, "for he saw clearly how they were all thrown in and piled up on top of one another and vying for power and trying to carve out niches." For Lowe and for all those whom his secret touches, hatred and love mix in equal measure--a volatile mixture, and one that may leave readers feeling somewhat stunned. <i>The Pagoda</i> is a fine novel, but not easy on anyone involved. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>"An exotic, richly-told tale...As the truth unfolds, it becomes clear that none of the characters are what they seem."<br>--<i>Phoenix Literary Supplement</i><p>"Powell has achieved something wonderful...Her brilliant writing, her careful sculpturing of Lowe and Miss Sylvie as 'passing' figures--one across gender, and the other across race lines-- enables us to experience the crossing of boundaries until the classifications become meaningless."<br>--Mariana Romo-Carmona, <i>MS</i> magazine</p><p>"An author of exceptional artistry and insight whose writing is extremely rich in sensual imagery."<br>--<i>Booklist</i></p><p>"An astonishing novel...a novelist of great talent and strength...an intricate, intimate, constantly surprising plot...a nuanced exploration of racial and sexual identity that transcends any specific time and place"<br>--Jonathan Wilson, <i>Boston Sunday Globe</i></p><p>"Luminously rendered...Impressively conceived...Like actors who wear masks not only to hide their identities but also to create new ones, the characters are not what they seem."<br>--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>"Sumptuously written and imagined...Vivid, disorienting &amp; strange...A vastly unusual novel"<br>--Rikki Ducornet</p></p><h2>The Infinite Atonement</h2><p>The Infinite Atonement is rapidly becoming a classic, as it offers what may be the most comprehensive treatment of the Atonement in our day.

These local tragedies&#x2015;and the protests surrounding them&#x2015;assumed national significance, igniting fierce debate about the fairness and efficacy of the American criminal justice system. Yet, outside the gaze of mainstream attention, how do local residents and protestors in Ferguson and Baltimore understand their own experiences with race, place, and policing?</p><p>In Hands Up, Don&#x2019;t Shoot, Jennifer Cobbina draws on in-depth interviews with nearly two hundred residents of Ferguson and Baltimore, conducted within two months of the deaths of Brown and Gray. She examines how protestors in both cities understood their experiences with the police, how those experiences influenced their perceptions of policing, what galvanized Black Lives Matter as a social movement, and how policing tactics during demonstrations influenced subsequent mobilization decisions among protesters. Ultimately, she humanizes people&#x2019;s deep and abiding anger, underscoring how a movement emerged to denounce both racial biases by police and the broader economic and social system that has stacked the deck against young black civilians.</p><p>Hands Up, Don&#x2019;t Shoot is a remarkably current, on-the-ground assessment of the powerful, protestor-driven movement around race, justice, and policing in America.</p></p><p><b>Jennifer E.

In this book the method by which the soul and the personality vehicles interact and function together is clearly presented. The author also reveals the relationship between what the occultist accepts in the constitution of man as the vital body, the etheric network with its energy vortices, or centres, and the physiological effects on the body through glandular secretions directly into the bloodstream. This is the endocrine system of glands, which correspond in the physical body to the energy centres in the etheric body and which, therefore, react to the type and potency of force the etheric body circulates at any one time. </p><p>Human behaviour, and the disposition of the physical body, are conditioned by the extent to which the personality vehicles either receive or reject the impulses of the soul; and this is conditioned by the emphasis or focus of consciousness at any one time. The physical vehicle is not a principle; it responds to any dominant force expressing itself through the etheric system of energy centres. A highly emotional condition, for example, in which the solar plexus energy centre in the vital body is overstimulated, powerfully affecting its physical counterpart, the pancreas gland, produces an oversecretion of the gland and a consequent general imbalance within the personality. </p><p>It is obvious that in a highly evolved man, the personality vehicles are aligned, the etheric body vital and balanced, and the energy centres controlling the physical body receptive to the influence of the soul through the mechanism of the integrated personality. But until this condition is created in consciousness, the mechanism of response is more or less isolated in its personality glamours. </p><p>It is said that the aspirant to discipleship really needs to know only two things: the constitution of man and the next step ahead. In this book the way the human constitution actually functions in its component parts is made abundantly clear. It is an accepted goal for the aspirant that he learns to make of his personality equipment an instrument for the soul to use. Knowledge of the relation between the subtle and the dense bodies, the etheric centres and the physical glands, energy and force the soul and its personality mechanism, can lift the process out of the vague haze which normally surrounds it, giving to it the clarity and precision of a scientific formula. </p><p>Not only, however, is this a matter of form and energy, the whole man is involved in the process and in the effects--psychologically, philosophically and spiritually; for energy flows as the result of thought, and the quality, nature and potency of thought is a matter of consciousness, which includes the whole way of living. Where the normal focus of consciousness is in daily life, there will be found the energy centre controlling the mechanism of response. </p><p></p></p><p>Alice A. Bailey, (1880-1949) From her conservative British background, Alice Bailey&#39;s life led her in many directions, but always in one direction--towards the time when through drastic personal experience of many kinds she had acquired a synthesis of outlook and understanding, and an absolute conviction that one divine life pervades and animates the one humanity; that the Plan for humanity requires the cooperation and service of trained and dedicated human beings intelligently informed about world affairs, in collaboration with those who form the spiritual Hierarchy, the inner government of the planet. Her life work became an integral part of this synthesis and this realization. Without in the least losing any of her very human qualities and involvement, her soul took up its commitment to her Master,and her personality provided full cooperation in the field of her accepted service. Basically her work developed as a duality--her discipleship service which included the establishment of an esoteric school; and her initially reluctant agreement to work with the Tibetan, Djwhal Khul, in the writing of a series of books presenting the next phase in the continuity of the Ageless Wisdom teaching. A total of twenty-four books were written by Alice Bailey. These books constitute a continuation of the Ageless Wisdom, a body of esoteric teaching handed down from ancient times in a form which is always suitable to each period. Intended to precede and condition the New Age, the Alice Bailey books offer an unparalleled spiritual approach to the teaching on Shamballa and the Path of spiritual evolution; the spiritual Hierarchy; the new discipleship and training in meditation as a form of service; the teaching on the seven rays and the new psychology of the soul; and the common thread of truth linking all the major world faiths. In addition to her work as an author and lecturer, Alice Bailey established the Lucis Publishing Company, making the teachings of Djwhal Khul available to spiritual seekers and students around the world for over 75 years. Reprinting of the books is financed through a revolving Fund under the administration of the Lucis Trust, a non-profit organization also founded by Alice A. Bailey. No royalties are paid and copyrights are owned by the Lucis Trust. Through these organizations, Alice Bailey provided for the continued publication of these teachings beyond her physical lifetime.An extract from the Tibetan teacher, written in 1934 briefly explains the intent of these teachings: The books that I have written are sent out with no claim for their acceptance. They may, or may not, be correct, true and useful. It is for you to ascertain their truth by right practice and by the exercise of the intuition. Neither I nor A.A.B. is the least interested in having them acclaimed as inspired writing, or in having anyone speak of them (with bated breath) as being the work of one of the masters. If they present truth in such a way that it follows sequentially upon that already offered in the world teachings, if the information given raises the aspiration and the will to serve from the plane of the emotions to that of the mind (the plane whereon the Masters can be found) then they will have served their purpose. If the teaching conveyed calls forth a response from the illumined mind of the worker in the world, and brings a flashing forth of the intuition, then let that teaching be accepted. But not otherwise. If the statements meet with eventual corroboration, or are deemed true under the test of the Law of Correspondences, then that is well and good. But should this not be so, let not the student accept what is said. --Lucis Publishing Company</p><h2>Famous Problems of Geometry and How to Solve Them (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p>It took two millennia to prove the impossible; that is, to prove it is not possible to solve some famous Greek problems in the Greek way (using only straight edge and compasses). In the process of trying to square the circle, trisect the angle and duplicate the cube, other mathematical discoveries were made; for these seemingly trivial diversions occupied some of history's great mathematical minds. Why did Archimedes, Euclid, Newton, Fermat, Gauss, Descartes among so many devote themselves to these conundrums? This book brings readers actively into historical and modern procedures for working the problems, and into the new mathematics that had to be invented before they could be "solved."<br>The quest for the circle in the square, the trisected angle, duplicated cube and other straight-edge-compass constructions may be conveniently divided into three periods: from the Greeks, to seventeenth-century calculus and analytic geometry, to nineteenth-century sophistication in irrational and transcendental numbers. Mathematics teacher Benjamin Bold devotes a chapter to each problem, with additional chapters on complex numbers and analytic criteria for constructability.

At its time, this book virtually kept me alive. . . . If you are not acquainted with it, then you cannot imagine what an effect it can have upon a person.&#x201d;&#x2014;Ludwig Wittgenstein, in a letter to Ludwig von Ficker.&nbsp;<i>The Gospel in Brief</i> is Leo Tolstoy&#x2019;s integration of the four biblical Gospels into a single account of the life of Jesus. Inspired in large measure by Tolstoy&#x2019;s meticulous study of the original Greek versions of the Bible, <i>The Gospel in Brief</i> is a highly original fusion of biblical texts and Tolstoy&#x2019;s own influential religious views.&nbsp;Tolstoy explains that his goal is a solution to &#x201c;the problem of life,&#x201d; not an answer to theological or historical questions. As a result, he sets aside such issues as Jesus&#x2019; genealogy and divinity, or whether Jesus in fact walked on water. Instead, he focuses on the words and teachings of Jesus, stripped of what Tolstoy regarded as the Church&#x2019;s distortions and focus on dogma and ritual. The result is a work that emphasizes the individual&#x2019;s spiritual condition in a chaotic and indifferent world.&nbsp;Like Tolstoy&#x2019;s celebrated literary achievements, <i>The Gospel in Brief</i> has the distinct bearing of a classic: in its urgency and directness it is remarkably current, as if it were written only yesterday rather than a century ago.</p><p><p>The most celebrated novelist of all time retells "the greatest story ever told," integrating the four Gospels into a single twelve-chapter narrative of the life of Jesus. Based on his study of early Christian texts, Leo Tolstoy's remarkable <em>The Gospel in Brief</em>&#x2014;virtually unknown to English readers until this landmark new translation by Dustin Condren&#x2014;makes accessible the powerful, mystical truth of Jesus's spiritual teaching, stripped of artificial church doctrine. "If you are not acquainted with <em>The Gospel in Brief</em>," wrote the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, whose life was profoundly influenced by it, "then you cannot imagine what an effect it can have upon a person."</p>Isabel Hapgood (1850&#x2013;1928), author of <i>A Survey of Russian Literature</i>, also translated works by Gogol, Turgenev, and Gorky.

As the star illustrator of <i>The Saturday Evening Post </i>for nearly half a century, Norman Rockwell mingled fact and fiction in paintings that reflected the we-the-people, communitarian ideals of American democracy. Freckled Boy Scouts and their mutts, sprightly grandmothers, a young man standing up to speak at a town hall meeting, a little black girl named Ruby Bridges walking into an all-white school&#x2015;here was an America whose citizens seemed to believe in equality and gladness for all.</p><p> Who was this man who served as our unofficial "artist in chief" and bolstered our country's national identity? Behind the folksy, pipe-smoking fa�ade lay a surprisingly complex figure&#x2015;a lonely painter who suffered from depression and was consumed by a sense of inadequacy. He wound up in treatment with the celebrated psychoanalyst Erik Erikson. In fact, Rockwell moved to Stockbridge, Massachusetts so that he and his wife could be near Austen Riggs, a leading psychiatric hospital. "What's interesting is how Rockwell's personal desire for inclusion and normalcy spoke to the national desire for inclusion and normalcy," writes Solomon. "His work mirrors his own temperament&#x2015;his sense of humor, his fear of depths&#x2015;and struck Americans as a truer version of themselves than the sallow, solemn, hard-bitten Puritans they knew from eighteenth-century portraits."</p><p> Deborah Solomon, a biographer and art critic, draws on a wealth of unpublished letters and documents to explore the relationship between Rockwell's despairing personality and his genius for reflecting America's brightest hopes. "The thrill of his work," she writes, "is that he was able to use a commercial form [that of magazine illustration] to thrash out his private obsessions." In <i>American Mirror</i>, Solomon trains her perceptive eye not only on Rockwell and his art but on the development of visual journalism as it evolved from illustration in the 1920s to photography in the 1930s to television in the 1950s. She offers vivid cameos of the many famous Americans whom Rockwell counted as friends, including President Dwight Eisenhower, the folk artist Grandma Moses, the rock musician Al Kooper, and the generation of now-forgotten painters who ushered in the Golden Age of illustration, especially J. C. Leyendecker, the reclusive legend who created the Arrow Collar Man.</p><p> Although derided by critics in his lifetime as a mere illustrator whose work could not compete with that of the Abstract Expressionists and other modern art movements, Rockwell has since attracted a passionate following in the art world. His faith in the power of storytelling puts his work in sync with the current art scene. <i>American Mirror </i>brilliantly explains why he deserves to be remembered as an American master of the first rank.</p></p><p>Deborah Solomon is the author of two previous biographies of American artists: <i>Jackson Pollock: A Biography</i> and <i>Utopia Parkway: The Life and Work of Joseph Cornell </i>(FSG, 1997). She has written about art and culture for many publications, and her weekly interview column, "Questions For," appeared in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i> from 2003 to 2011. She lives in New York City with her family.ONE <br>THE BIRD MAN OF YONKERS <br>(1830 TO 1888) <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>For every Rembrandt, for every artist whose work shines across the divide of centuries, there are thousands of artists whose names have been forgotten. Their work remains invisible to us, shuttered away in moldering basements and junk shops where no one has bothered to dust it off and look at it for decades. It&#x2019;s not a tragedy. It&#x2019;s simply the law of the art jungle: lesser artists fall into obscurity over time. And then there&#x2019;s even a lower category, those who never had the good fortune to climb to a respectable professional height from which to plummet. <br>Such an artist was Howard Hill, who endured most every disappointment that can attend the artistic life. Today, you won&#x2019;t find his paintings in any museums and he isn&#x2019;t mentioned in any books on American art. This is not entirely unjust. An intense, wounded man with a drinking problem, he was too overwhelmed by the demands of daily living to sustain the discipline needed for art. He died a pauper in 1888 and is buried in Yonkers, New York, in an an unmarked grave. <br>Hill was Norman Rockwell&#x2019;s maternal grandfather; he died six years before Rockwell was born. Yet, an absence can be more vivid than a presence, and Hill would exert a large influence on his grandson. As Rockwell grew up, he had ample opportunity to look at any number of Hill&#x2019;s paintings that were hanging in his home or in those of his relatives, and to hear his mother recall the flamboyant life that had produced them. <br>Born in London in 1830, Hill spent most of his career as an artist-�migr� in Yonkers, New York, painting pictures of animals. Not elegant English animals, like the queen&#x2019;s spaniels or the glossy-haired horses of George Stubbs. Rather, he was fascinated by barnyard birds of the scruffiest sort: ducks and grouses and quail, even roosters and chickens. He might portray a mother quail with a covey of little chicks standing in tall grass, at the edge of the woods, a meadow and sky unfurling in the distance. Bird painting, let&#x2019;s call it, occupied its own tiny niche in the market for landscapes that had been opened up by the painters of the Hudson River School, which, of course, was not a school but the first-ever bona fide art movement in America. <br>Was Hill a neglected master? Hardly. Rockwell, for one, referred to his pictures as &#x201c;pot-boilers.&#x201d; But as a child who was gifted at drawing and uncommonly observant, he took note of certain similarities between his work and that of his grandfather. Hill, he saw, drew with care and loaded up his pictures with minute detail. Perhaps Rockwell had inherited Hill&#x2019;s precisionist way with a pencil or perhaps he had consciously appropriated it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure all the detail in my grandfather&#x2019;s pictures had something to do with the way I&#x2019;ve always painted,&#x201d; he once noted. &#x201c;Right from the beginning I always strived to capture everything I saw as completely as possible.&#x201d;1 <br>In his later years, when Rockwell was seventy-three and working out of a barn-turned-studio in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, he was informed that one of his grandfather&#x2019;s bird paintings ( <i>Game Bird and Family</i>) was coming up for auction at Parke-Bernet in New York. Although he was not a sentimental person and in fact could be callous with relatives, he called the auction house and then confirmed in a letter: &#x201c;As you advised, I am willing to make a bid of $250, and more if necessary, because I want to get the picture.&#x201d; He wound up paying $350.2 <br>Who&#x2019;s to say why one realist painter lives and dies in unrelieved obscurity while another enjoys the opposite fate&#x2014;that is, rises out of nowhere to become wealthy and famous and is invited to dine with the president at the White House? This is not a question that Rockwell was likely to contemplate. He was not inclined to look back. He was one of the most efficient artists who ever lived. He never wasted a day. Is it possible to make art without risking failure? He would find a way. This, too, was part of his inheritance from Hill, whose fate alerted him to the hazards of the artistic life. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>This story begins in London, on July 16, 1851, a Wednesday. That was the day on which Hill married a young dressmaker. Her name was Ann Patmore and she was the daughter of a servant. She had just turned twenty-two; he was slightly younger. At the time, he was living with his parents at 10 Smith Street, in a dingy brick house in Chelsea. On the marriage certificate, Hill listed himself as &#x201c;Artist.&#x201d; His father had to sign the document as well and gave his occupation as &#x201c;House decorator,&#x201d; which at the time referred to a tradesman who knew how to hang wallpaper and paint wood. <br>Painters in London were not a homogenous group. A hierarchy ruled. The ship painter was rated below the house painter, who in turn was rated below the sign painter. The mural painter and easel painters were at the top of the heap. In describing himself as an &#x201c;artist,&#x201d; Hill was referring, perhaps, less to his achievements than his plan for the future: he did not intend to wind up painting houses like his father. <br>In the seven years following their marriage, Howard and Ann remained in Chelsea and three children were born: Susan Ann, Thomas, and Amy Eliza.3 During that time, Hill&#x2019;s career had its ups and downs, and probably more of the latter. When their first child was baptized, Hill and his wife were living on Jubilee Place and he listed his trade as &#x201c;decorator,&#x201d; as if momentarily knocked off his perch. When their second child was baptized, he was back up to to the status of &#x201c;artist.&#x201d; And when their third child was born, they did not bother having her baptized, perhaps because they were in the process of packing up their meager possessions and preparing to sail for America, where his parents had already settled. <br>Leaving England by crowded steerage, Hill&#x2014;accompanied by Ann and their three young children&#x2014;sailed from Liverpool and arrived in this country on March 22, 1858. The trip in second cabin took eight days and when they docked at the pier in New York Harbor, they arrived in a city teeming with immigrants. The streets were thronged with horses and wagons and pushcart vendors from whom you could buy a pickle or a cabbage or a live chicken. If you walked uptown on Broadway, the crowds and big buildings dwindled after Fourteenth Street, and the area known as Herald Square was considered the countryside. Up on Fifty-ninth Street, a beautiful park was about to open. It was modeled on a picturesque park in England that Hill knew well, Birkenhead Park, and perhaps he wondered why it had no name, other than &#x201c;the central park.&#x201d; <br>Our first indication of Hill&#x2019;s whereabouts in America surfaces in the 1860 federal census. He and Ann were living in Yonkers, north of the city, a stretch of verdant dairy farms. Moving into the home of his widowed father, they stayed long enough for a daughter to be born in 1861. Immediately afterward, he moved his family to Hoboken, New Jersey, which was closer to the city, directly across the river from Manhattan, on the west bank of the Hudson. White-painted ferries and steamships glided by all day. Throughout the Civil War, Hill lived in Hoboken, an artist-immigrant gazing out over the river. <br>He got off to a promising start. He landed a job with Currier &amp; Ives, the famous printmakers, who were based in Manhattan. Neither Nathaniel Currier nor James Merritt Ives was actually an artist. Rather, they were marketing wizards who employed dozens of artists and devised the ingenious idea of advertising their art inventory in attractive catalogs they published themselves. Some of the prints were engraved copies of paintings, but most of them were original images drawn by artists who remained unacknowledged. The prints were run off in black-and-white and then, after drying for a day or so, were finished by low-paid women who sat at long tables with stencils and pots of brightly colored inks. <br>The shop at 152 Nassau Street advertised itself as a &#x201c;Grand Depot for Cheap and Popular Prints,&#x201d; which was actually true. Anyone could drop by and browse through the racks of hand-colored lithographs. The inventory was constantly changing, although certain motifs were nearly sacrosanct, such as rural landscapes with two-story farmhouses and split-rail fences and horses trotting along a dirt road. Many of the prints seem to say, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll all feel better with some fresh country air.&#x201d; An inexplicably large number portray snow-covered farmhouses, with light playing off the rooftops and ground, as if it were possible to leach the grayness not only out of art, but out of winter as well. <br>The prints may have been technically awkward or unpolished, but they were usually lively, jammed with lots of informative details. And they were certainly reasonable. Prices, according to the firm&#x2019;s 1860 catalog, started at eight cents and went up to more than three dollars. Any housewife could afford to buy a lithograph to frame and hang in the parlor. <br>Moreover, you could have the pleasure of exercising your taste by picking out one from among hundreds, preferably one that expressed &#x201c;the sincere ideas and tastes of the house and not the tyrannical dicta of some art critic or neighbor,&#x201d; as Harriet Beecher Stowe put it in her bestselling advice book, <i>The American Woman&#x2019;s Home</i>, in 1869. Her comment remains the only takedown to dismiss art critics and neighbors with equal harshness. <br>Nothing is viewed as more quintessentially American than Currier &amp; Ives prints, but the irony is that most of the firm&#x2019;s illustrators were British �migr�s. Many good scenes of the Rocky Mountains were produced by Currier &amp; Ives artists who had trained in London and never traveled very far west of the Hudson River. <br>Hill did not last long at the Currier &amp; Ives shop. Whether he was too mercurial to hold down a job or too self-regarding to submit to the drudgery of copying paintings by other artists, he soon went off on his own. This is the period when he started painting groupings of ducks and quails in scenic landscapes, and it seems likely that he was influenced by James John Audubon&#x2019;s famous illustrations. It had been a generation since Audubon had published his <i>Birds of America</i>, with its hand-colored engravings of every species he could find. Some of Hill&#x2019;s paintings combine images of Audubon birds with a woodsy landscape setting. Most of his paintings were done on small canvases, about ten by twelve inches, and some are just six by eleven inches. They&#x2019;re painted in a tight, detail-laden style and when they err, it is on the side of preciousness. <br>In New York the economy boomed during the Civil War and Hill prospered. He took a studio in Manhattan and was listed in the city directory as &#x201c;Howard Hill artist 609 Broadway, residence Hoboken.&#x201d; In 1865, four of his bird paintings were included in the most important survey show of the year&#x2014;the fortieth Annual Exhibition at the National Academy of Design, which had just moved into a grand new building on East Twenty-third Street. At the time, the Academy was the foremost art school and museum in the city; in fact, it was the only art museum. There was no Metropolitan Museum of Art. There were no public rooms where you could see a Rembrandt or a Vermeer or even minor Dutch masters. The Manhattan art world then consisted of little more than the National Academy and some commercial shops down on Nassau Street where middling paintings were auctioned off like so much old furniture. There were a few art dealers, but their loyalty was to fashionable French artists, such as Adolphe-William Bouguereau, who painted female nudes with silky skin and cherubs fluttering in the sky. American artists were left to dispose of their work at group exhibitions, the most important one being the Academy&#x2019;s annuals. <br>On April 27, 1865, less than two weeks after the assassination of President Lincoln, the Academy held an opening reception for its fortieth Annual Exhibition. Despite the recent tragedy, it proved to be a glittery social event. A writer for <i>Harper&#x2019;s Weekly</i> took note of the &#x201c;gay and flashing groups&#x201d; of visitors. The women wore gowns; the men were in frocks and silk top hats. They gathered in sumptuous rooms with Persian carpets to look at paintings that were hung salon-style, from floor to ceiling. More than a hundred artists were in the show, all of them at the mercy of the Hanging Committee, as it was called, somewhat ominously. Artists who had prayed to God that their work would be granted a central eye-level spot were likely to have spent opening night wondering why their pictures had been relegated to the hazy margins. Humbler painters, on the other hand, were no doubt thrilled to find themselves in such prestigious company. The speakers that night included William Cullen Bryant, the long-bearded nature poet and newspaper editor, who praised the Academy as an institution that had finally reached its &#x201c;ripe maturity.&#x201d;4 <br>So, for one all-too-brief moment, Hill was a man whose career appeared to be ascendant, a British �migr� whose life intersected with the brightest stars in American art. Winslow Homer, Albert Bierstadt, George Inness, and Sanford Gifford were among his coexhibitors at the Academy, and he may have personally met them at the opening reception. Perhaps he shook their hands or even had a chat. Or perhaps he didn&#x2019;t and was sick with regret when he got home that night. <br>This was the heyday of landscape painting in America and Bierstadt was the most celebrated of the lot. He painted sweeping views of the American West, scenes of tall cliffs and orange-y sunsets that seemed designed to show space at its most abundant, to insert miles of dewy vapor between you and the mountain peaks. <br>One of the mysteries of Hill&#x2019;s career is that he did not endow his pictures with similar grandeur. Although he lived on top of the Hudson River&#x2014;in Yonkers to the east and then in Hoboken to the west&#x2014;he never painted a river view. Perhaps he was indifferent to romantic vistas. Perhaps, instead of inspiring him, they intimidated him. Distant views, especially those of mountains, diminish the observer to a tiny speck, to insignificance. Hill preferred things you can see at close range. Not views, exactly, but objects within your own space, the space you inhabit every day from the moment you get out of bed and feel the floorboards beneath your bare feet. He preferred his birds. He had a real sympathy for them. Not swift ones tearing through the sky, but birds that exhibited no desire to fly, that were content to bump around on the ground. <br>No photographs of Hill are known to survive. No letters either. As a result, his appearance and his ideas about painting remain largely unknown to us, and his life story must be jiggered together from family stories and whatever scant mention he received in newspapers and other documents. After appearing in two annuals at the National Academy in as many years, his name disappears for a while. It pops up again in 1868 and 1869, in small-print classified advertisements in <i>The New York Herald</i>. The ads were placed by the auctioneer Philip Levy, who sold &#x201c;choice Oil Paintings&#x201d; at the Artists&#x2019; Salesroom on Nassau Street; Hill was one of the artists in his stable.5 <br>He surfaces next in the 1870 census, which describes him as a forty-year-old &#x201c;artiste,&#x201d; as if he were French. His wife gave her occupation as &#x201c;keeping house.&#x201d; They were no longer in Hoboken, but one town over, in Jersey City. The value of his personal estate was estimated at $300 and unlike some of his neighbors, who included a brick mason and a produce dealer, Hill did not own his house. <br>He had a large brood by now: six children ranging from an eighteen-year-old dau...</p><h2>The Penwyth Curse (Song Novels)</h2><p>Sir Bishop of Lythe has come to Penwyth for his royal reward&#x2014;the keep and young Merryn's hand.

When the king gives the castle to Sir Bishop of Lythe, he must find a way to secure it and the lady without becoming the latest victim of the curse. Anne Flosnik's narration, humorous and enticing to Coulter's fans, suffers from the alternation between Bishop's story and that of an unnamed witch and wizard in a different, unnamed time. The difficulty in keeping track of the two story lines is unlikely to draw many new listeners to the series, although fans will enjoy.

Because the Wright brothers worked in secrecy, word of their first flights had not reached Europe when Santos-Dumont took to the skies in 1906. The dashing, impeccably dressed inventor entertained Paris with his airborne antics--barhopping in a little dirigible that he tied to lampposts, circling above crowds around the Eiffel Tower, and crashing into rooftops. A man celebrated, even pursued by the press in Paris, London, and New York, Santos-Dumont dined regularly with the Cartiers, the Rothschilds, and the Roosevelts. But beneath his lively public exterior, Santos-Dumont was a frenzied genius tortured by the weight of his own creation.<br><br> <em>Wings of Madness</em> chronicles the science and history of early aviation and offers a fascinating glimpse into the mind of an extraordinary and tormented man, vividly depicting the sights and sounds of turn-of-the-century Paris. It is a book that will do for aviation what <em>The Man Who Loved Only Numbers</em> did for mathematics.</p><p><strong>Paul Hoffman </strong>was president of Encyclopedia Britannica and editor-in-chief of <em>Discover</em> and is the author of <em>The Man Who Loved Only Numbers</em> and <em>The Wings of Madness</em>. He is the winner of the first National Magazine Award for Feature Writing, and his work has appeared in the <em>New Yorker</em>, <em>Time</em>, and <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>. He lives in Woodstock, NY.This thoroughly entertaining history of one of the currently overlooked heroes from early-20th-century aviation equals that of Hoffman's earlier volume, The Man Who Loved Only Numbers. Almost unknown today except in his native Brazil (where he is a revered figure), Alberto Santos-Dumont was known throughout the world as "a maverick among contemporary aeronauts." Obsessed with the idea of flight from an early age, Santos-Dumont (1873-1932) was an eccentric genius whose inherited wealth allowed him to live in luxury in fin-de-siecle Paris, at first working on ballooning. After designing small, cigar-shaped, engine-powered vehicles, which he used for everything from traveling around Paris to circling the Eiffel Tower, he soon became one of the best-known men in the city. Later he built "the world's first sports plane." Hoffman expertly recaptures from the historical dustbin the many facets of this unique character who befriended the Rothschilds and Cartiers, ran in the same crowd as Marcel Proust and devoted his life to a singular passion unmatched even by the obsessive Wright Brothers during the early days of aviation, "a time when the vast majority of Europeans and Americans had not yet traveled along the ground in an automobile."<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Secret Church (Louise A.

It can lead the artist toward revelation, but it must also, Lorca says, accept and even serenade the possibility of death. Tracy K.

As interpreted by Smith in her Laughlin Award&#x2013;winning second collection, <i>duende</i> is the unforgiving place where the soul confronts emotion, acknowledges death and finds poetry. Smith writes from various unconsoled spaces, where [k]nowledge is regret and [e]ach word is a wish. About the view from a failing marriage, Smith says: I liked best/ When there was nothing/ That I could/ Or could not see. These 30 poems are roving, alluding to diverse countries and political situations, often shifting perspectives and locations abruptly between sections. Identity and history are often sources of pain, and Smith adopts various marginalized personas (Flores Woman, Persephone, John Dall, Ugandan girls sold into wifedom) unhinged by displacement. Identity politics bleed into personal lyric, where the poet admits, I am not/ What you intend me to be. Writing in the voice of a Ugandan girl, Smith says, Somewhere in every life there is a line./ One side to the other and you are gone./ Not disappeared but undone. Although the site of undoing may well be the source of <i>duende</i>, the poet's lyric brilliance and political impulses never falter under the considerable weight of her subject matter. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The tantric paradigm for this process is the story of the Indian master Naropa (1016-1100), who is among the enlightened teachers of the Kagyu lineage of the Tibetan Buddhism. Naropa was the leading scholar at Nalanda, the Buddhist monastic university, when he embarked upon the lonely and arduous path to enlightenment. After a series of daunting trials, he was prepared to receive the direct transmission of the awakened state of mind from his guru, Tilopa. Teachings that he received, including those known as the six doctrines of Naropa, have been passed down in the lineages of Tibetan Buddhism for a millennium. Trungpa&#39;s commentary shows the relevance of Naropa&#39;s extraordinary journey for today&#39;s practitioners who seek to follow the spiritual path. Naropa&#39;s story makes it possible to delineate in very concrete terms the various levels of spiritual development that lead to the student&#39;s readiness to meet the teacher&#39;s mind.

Louisville Slugger bats still reign supreme in major league baseball. The city was also the birthplace of the famed Hot Brown and Benedictine spread, and the cheeseburger made its debut at Kaelin's Restaurant on Newburg Road in 1934. The "Happy Birthday" had its origins in the Louisville kindergarten class of sisters Mildred Jane Hill and Patty Smith Hill. Named for King Louis XVI of France in appreciation for his assistance during the Revolutionary War, Louisville was founded by George Rogers Clark in 1778. The city has been home to a number of men and women who changed the face of American history. President Zachary Taylor was reared in surrounding Jefferson County, and two U.S. Supreme Court Justices were from the city proper. Second Lt. F.

His novel not only won the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> First Novel prize in 2001 but it has sold over 100,000 copies. This book is as much a companion volume to Jimmy Corrigan --one of the great crossover success stories-- as a tremendous art collection from of one of America's most interesting and popular graphic artist.</p><p>Chris Ware has a passion for drawing that is surprisingly wide-ranging in style and subject. This book surprises the reader on every page with its sense of spontaneous vision. Architectural drawings from Chicago and interplanetary robot comics collide with cruelly doodled human figures and quietly troubling studies of the still life. A must for people with a passion for modern design and old-fashioned style.</p></p><p>Cartoonist/designer <b>Chris Ware</b> is the author of <i>Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth</i>, <i>Quimby the Mouse</i>, and the <i>ACME Novelty Datebook</i>. Ware was born in 1967, two years before Frank King&#x2019;s death.Prolific alternative-comics artist Ware follows his epic, <i>Jimmy Corrigan</i> (2000), and <i>Quimby the Mouse</i> [BKL S 1 03] with a collection of sketchbook pages. Ware owes his lofty reputation largely to his awesome command of the "grammar" of comics, and this handsome volume showcasing his drawing ability amounts to something of a new revelation. Ware's strips are so meticulous in their rigid perfection that they seem to indicate an obsessive character. Yet these hundreds of life drawings, cityscapes, doodles, preliminary sketches, and other drawings, rendered in an impressive variety of styles, contrarily display unexpected spontaneity and looseness. Particularly revelatory are a handful of actual strips in Ware's familiar multipanel approach, and featuring Jimmy, Quimby, and other characters from his long stories, that are rendered in a rougher, almost crude style. Ware's fans will find his marginal notes fascinating, too, for their revelations about his creative process. Besides showing off Ware's facility and variety, this beautifully designed book demonstrates just how much thought and planning go into his acclaimed graphic novels. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.

Those who are a part of this institution unquestionably believe in a god that directs their activities and they look to this deity with the ultimate hope of gaining his favor. They, unlike many of the people ascribed to the popular religions of today, have no doubt that their god lives and interacts with them. They see the favor their god bestows upon them. The riches and power gained through their piety actively demonstrates the reality of their god&#39;s existence. The precepts of their secretive religion are contra to that of the Judeo-Christian religion that values above all, love for their fellow man. They consider the people outside of their group inferior creatures, unworthy of their god, but necessary for manipulation towards the completion of their final objective. Through devotion, submission to the will of their god, and dedication to his secretive plan, they believe that they will achieve immortality and live in a coming golden age where their god will appear on earth and rule them in a new paradise of his design. Just as the Judeo Christian God gave His followers the Arc of The Covenant, which held great power, the god of the mystery religion has given his followers an object whose existence has been kept secret since the Middle Ages and whose power is beyond comprehension. This object grants absolute hegemony to those who possess it as well as the ability to increase supremacy through war and conquest. Throughout history, when men failed in their discernment of its power, it was transferred to others more worthy. This object still exits and is in the possession of an elite group who will do anything to protect it. This book reveals for the first time its history and the greatest secret of all, where it is hidden today.</p><p></p><h2>Cassandra: Florence Nightingale&#39;s Angry Outcry Against the Forced Idleness of Victorian Women</h2><p>The world knows Florence Nightingale as "the lady with the lamp"&#x2014;the revered founder of nursing as a respectable profession for women. But few people are aware that Nightingale's career began only after years of struggle to free herself from her suffocating Victorian family. In this surprisingly passionate feminist essay (a "brilliant polemic," states Martha Vicinus), Nightingale denounces the lives of idleness she and other women of&nbsp;her class were forced to lead.<br></p><p>Florence Nightingale (1820-1910) earned the nickname "The Lady With the Lamp" for her tireless nursing of British soldiers during the Crimean War. Nightingale was born to wealthy English parents and proved to be a quick-witted and independent child. She eventually became interested in nursing and, despite opposition from her parents, trained as a nurse and began work in a London clinic. When the Crimean War broke out in 1854, she led a group of three dozen nurses to Constantinople to serve in British military hospitals there. She cajoled army officials to change the terrible conditions in the hospitals, thus earning the gratitude of soldiers and a measure of public fame. When the war ended in 1856 she returned to London and continued her reform campaign there.<br><br>Nightingale's outspoken <i>Notes on Matters Affecting the Health, Efficiency and Hospital Administration of the British Army</i> and <i>Notes on Hospitals</i> helped create changes in hygiene and overall treatment of patients. She also founded the groundbreaking Nightingale Training School for nurses, and in later years published dozens of books and pamphlets on public health. Nightingale was awarded the Royal Red Cross by Queen Victoria in 1883, and in 1907 became the first woman to receive the Order of Merit."Over the years <em>Cassandra</em> has maintained its position as a focal feminist text, an important documentary link between women's earlier struggles for personal, legal, and political liberties, and the full-blown fight for emancipation that emerged in the first decade of the 20th century."<br>&#x2015;<strong><em>The Guardian</em></strong><br><br>"Over the years <i>Cassandra</i> has maintained its position as a focal feminist text, an important documentary link between women's earlier struggles for personal, legal, and political liberties, and the full-blown fight for emancipation that emerged in the first decade of the 20th century."<br> <b><i>The Guardian</i></b></p><h2>Asterix and Obelix All at Sea: Album #30 (Asterix, 30)</h2><p>In ancient Rome, the slaves are rebelling&#x2014;and they&#x2019;ve even stolen Julius Caesar&#x2019;s own warship, the finest in the Roman navy.

For Hal�k, patience is the main difference between faith and atheism. Faith, hope, and love are three aspects of patience in the face of God&#x2019;s silence, which is interpreted as &#x201c;the death of God&#x201d; by atheists and is not taken seriously enough by fundamentalists.<br><br>Using the gospel story of Jesus&#x2019;s encounter with Zacchaeus, Hal�k issues an invitation to all people who stand (like Zacchaeus did) on the sideline&#x2014;curious but noncommittal. The fact that Jesus gravitated to the poor and the marginalized means that he also has a special place in his heart for diligent seekers on the margins of the community of believers.</p><p>TOM�&#x160; HAL�K worked as a psychotherapist during the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia and at the same time was secretly ordained as a Catholic priest and active in the underground church. Since the fall of the regime, he has served as General Secretary to the Czech Conference of Bishops and was an adviser to V�clav Havel. He has lectured at many universities throughout the world and is currently a professor of philosophy and sociology at Charles University. His books, which are bestsellers in his own country, have been translated into many languages and have received several literary prizes.CHAPTER 1<br> Addressing Zacchaeus<br>It was early morning and fresh snow lay in the streets of Prague. Everything was fairly fresh in those days--the mid-1990s. A few years earlier, the Communist regime had fallen in the course of the "Velvet Revolution," along with its monopoly of political and police power, and for the first time in decades genuine parliamentary democracy was restored. The church and the university once more enjoyed freedom. That turn of events wrought enormous changes in my life: during the 1970s, I had been secretly ordained abroad at a time of religious repression at home that had already lasted decades. Not even my mother, with whom I lived, was allowed to know I was a priest. For eleven years, I performed my priestly duties clandestinely in an "underground church." Now I was able to function openly, freely, as a priest, without any risk of repression, in the newly created university parish in the heart of Old Prague. After years during which I had to give lectures on philosophy solely as part of clandestine courses in private homes organized by the "flying university," could only publish in samizdat, I was able to return to the university, write for the newspapers, and publish books.<br>But on that particular winter morning I was headed, not for the church or the university, but for the parliament building. Among the novelties of those days was the custom, established a few years earlier, of inviting a member of the clergy to the parliament once a year, just before Christmas, to deliver a brief meditation to the assembled members of parliament and senators prior to the last sitting before the Christmas vacation.<br>Yes, everything was still fairly fresh and retained a whiff of newly won freedom. Yet a few years had passed since the "Velvet Revolution," and the first waves of euphoria and its heady confrontation with open spaces were things of the past. The initial illusions had evaporated, and many previously unsuspected problems and complications were appearing in public life. Gradually, something that psychiatrists call "agoraphobia" was creeping into society: a dread of open spaces, literally a fear of the marketplace. Almost everything imaginable was suddenly available on the market in goods and ideas--but many people were confused and puzzled by the enormous diversity of what was on offer and the necessity of making choices. Some of them got a headache from the sudden, blinding profusion of color, and now and then they even began to miss the black-and-white world of yesteryear--although in fact it had been tediously and boringly gray.<br>I concluded my words to the members of parliament and senators--most of whom had probably never held a Bible in their hands--with a reference to the scene from Luke's Gospel in which Jesus moves through the crowds in Jericho and unexpectedly addresses a chief tax collector who is secretly observing him from the branches of a fig tree.<br>I compared the story with the behavior of Christians in our country. When, after the fall of Communism, Christ's followers came out freely into the open after so many years, they noticed many people who applauded them and maybe a few who had previously shaken their fists at them. What they didn't notice, however, was that the trees all around them were full of Zacchaeuses--those who were unwilling or unable to join the throng of old or brand-new believers, but were neither indifferent nor hostile to them. Those Zacchaeuses were curious seekers, but at the same time they wanted to maintain a certain distance. That odd combination of inquisitiveness and expectation, interest and shyness, and sometimes, maybe, even a feeling of guilt and "inadequacy," kept them hidden in their fig trees.<br>By addressing Zacchaeus by name, Jesus emboldened him to come down from his hiding place. He surprised him by wanting to stay in his house even though He risked immediate slander and criticism: "He's accepted the hospitality of a sinner!"<br>There is no written account of Zacchaeus's ever having joined Jesus's disciples, nor of his having followed Jesus on His travels like the chosen twelve or the throng of other men and women. What we do know, however, is that he decided to change his life, and salvation came to his house. In our times, the church has been incapable of addressing its Zacchaeuses in like manner.<br>I warned the politicians against something similar happening at the civic and political levels. While it was true that many people were still observing the new beginning of democracy in our country--maybe after a certain period of initial general euphoria--with curiosity and some eagerness, for various reasons they also had misgivings and a certain diffidence. But maybe many of them were subconsciously waiting for the moment when they would be addressed or invited directly by someone or something. How many politicians, who spent their time organizing their supporters and contending with opponents, were prepared to understand those Zacchaeuses, to take a sincere and respectful interest in them and "address them by name," talk to them, make their acquaintance? Maybe on account of that failure, many "tax collectors" didn't change their lives, many wrongs were not righted, and many hopes were dashed.<br>Zacchaeus may appear to some to be an incorrigible individualist, an "outsider"; where people are only too ready to line up in enthusiastic or angry ranks, he instinctively seeks a hiding place in the branches of a fig tree. He doesn't do so out of pride, as it might appear; after all, he is well aware of his "small stature" and his great failings, of his shortcomings vis-�-vis absolute postulates and challenges. Yet he is able and willing to abandon his privacy and his detachment if "addressed by name"--then, all of a sudden, he just might accept those absolute challenges and change his life. The only person capable of addressing Zacchaeus, however, is someone for whom those people hidden in the branches of a fig tree are not strangers or aliens--someone who doesn't disdain them, who has concern for them, someone who can respond to what happens in their hearts and minds.<br>There are plenty of Zacchaeuses in our midst. The fate of our world, our church, and society depends more than we are willing to admit on the extent to which these Zacchaeuses will be won over or not.<br>I finished my meditation, but the story of Zacchaeus was still on my mind. I walked here and there through pre-Christmas Prague and strove to identify why it was that this particular passage had caught my imagination so strongly. And then I realized that this very story could help to achieve a clearer and deeper understanding of what I had long regarded subconsciously as my own particular mission and vocation.<br>In my pastoral work as a priest, but also in all my other fields of activity--my books and articles, university teaching, and the media--my aim has always been neither "converting the converted," nor caring for the orderly sheep of the flock, nor even engaging in never-ending polemics and disputes with opponents. I don't think my chief vocation ought to be "mission" in the classical sense, if by that one means winning over as many people as possible to one's own church flock or political persuasion. I feel that my chief purpose is to be an understanding neighbor for those who find it impossible to join the exultant crowds beneath the unfurled flags of whatever color, for those who keep their distance.<br>I like Zacchaeuses. I think I have been given the gift of understanding them. People often construe the distance that Zacchaeuses maintain as an expression of their "superiority," but I don't think they are right--things aren't that simple. In my experience, it is more the result of shyness. In some cases, the reason for their aversion to crowds, particularly ones with slogans and banners, is that they suspect that the truth is too fragile to be chanted on the street.<br>Most of those people did not choose their place "on the margins" voluntarily. It could well be that some of them are also reticent because--like Zacchaeus--they are all too aware that their own house is not in order, and they realize, or at least suspect, that changes need to be made in their own lives. Maybe, unlike the unfortunate person in one of Jesus's parables, they realize they are not properly attired for the wedding and therefore cannot take a seat among the guests of honor at the wedding feast.2 They are still on the journey, dusty and far from the goal. They are not yet "ready" to display themselves to others in the full light of day, maybe because they find themselves in a blind alley on their life's journey.<br>And yet they sense the urgent moment when something of importance passes by them. It has a force of attraction, as it had for Zacchaeus, who longed to set eyes on Jesus. But sometimes, as in Zacchaeus's case, they hide their spiritual yearning with fig leaves--from others and sometimes from themselves too.<br>The only person capable of addressing Zacchaeus is someone who "knows his name" and knows his secret. Someone for whom this human type is not alien, who is capable of empathizing with the complex reasons for his reticence. It would seem that the only person truly capable of empathizing with the Zacchaeuses of our days is someone who once was, and to a certain extent still is, a Zacchaeus. People who feel most at home within the exultant crowds will probably find it hard to understand such a type.<br>I once saw on the wall of a Prague subway station the inscription "Jesus is the answer," probably written by someone on the way back from some high-spirited evangelistic gathering. Yet someone else had aptly added the words: "But what was the question?" It reminded me of the comment made by the philosopher Eric Voegelin that the biggest problem for today's Christians wasn't that they didn't have the right answers, but that they'd forgotten the question to which they were the answers.<br>Answers without questions--without the questions that originally provoked them, but also without the subsequent questions that are provoked by every answer--are like trees without roots. But how often are "Christian truths" presented to us like felled, lifeless trees in which birds can no longer find a nest? (As a young professor, Joseph Ratzinger apparently commented, apropos of Jesus's parable about the kingdom of heaven being like a tree in which birds make their nests, that the church is beginning dangerously to resemble a tree with many dead branches on which there frequently sit some rather odd birds--although I'm not sure how willing he would be these days to sign that statement with the pontifical pen or append the "the fisherman's seal.")<br>It takes the confrontation of questions and answers to return a real meaning and dynamic to our statements. Truth happens in the course of dialogue. There is always a temptation to allow our answers to bring to an end the process of searching, as if the topic of the conversation was a problem that has now been solved. But when a fresh question arrives, the unexhausted depths of mystery show through once more. Let it be said over and over again: faith is not a question of problems but of mystery, so we must never abandon the path of seeking and asking. Yes, in seeking Zacchaeus we must often shift from problems to mystery, from apparently final answers back to infinite questions.<br>Paul, the "thirteenth apostle," who did the most to spread the Gospel, wrote: I have become all things to all. Maybe at this time we will discover Christ's closeness most effectively if we, his disciples, make ourselves seekers with those who seek and questioners with those who question. There are more than enough of those who declare they have already reached their goal and offer ready-made but often facile answers, and unfortunately they are also to be found among those who invoke the name of Jesus. Maybe we will make our belief more accessible to the Zacchaeuses of our day if we make them our neighbors, in Jesus's sense, as they "look out through the leaves."<br>I once came across a book by a bishop with the subtitle "a book for seekers and doubters." Out of curiosity I picked it up, particularly as I was personally acquainted with the author and liked him. However, after a few pages, I realized that the subtitle--whether it was the work of the author or of an enterprising publisher--was simply an advertising gimmick. It was evident from the entire tone of the book that the author's attitude to seekers was one of someone who had already found what he wanted, while he regarded doubters as people whose doubts he could easily turn into certainties.<br>At that moment I decided I would write books of a different kind--as a doubter among doubters and a seeker among seekers. And I soon had the feeling that the Lord had really accepted that intention and taken it even more seriously than I had when the idea first struck me. But in order to ensure that this work would not be a sham, God managed to undermine many of the religious certainties I had previously embraced. In doing so, He prepared at the same time a surprising and very valuable gift for me: at the very moment of "rift," at that moment of shaken and collapsing certainties, at the very moment of more and more questions and doubts, he showed me his face more clearly than ever before.<br>I realized that the "encounter with God"--conversion, assenting in faith with how God reveals Himself and the church presents that revelation--was not the end of the journey. To have faith means to "follow in the footsteps"; in this world it takes the form of a never-ending journey. True religious faith on earth can never end like a successful search for some object or other--i.e., by finding and possessing--because it is not directed toward some material end, but to the heart of mystery, which is inexhaustible and bottomless.<br>The path to the Zacchaeuses of today--people often on the fringe or beyond the visible frontiers of the churches, in the zone of questions and doubts, in that singular region between the two fortified camps of those "whose minds are made up" (i.e., self-assured believers and self-assured atheists)--helped me get a fresh understanding of faith and of the One to whom faith relates.<br>Insofar as we are disciples of Christ, we want Him to be the one whom the Zacchaeuses of today encounter. I too, even while working on this book--I am a priest, after all--asked myself what it really means these days to bring someone closer to Christ, and, through Christ, closer to God. I don't think it is quite as easy as certain enthusiastic Christians believe. A priest must not become an agitator, a propagandist, someone with pat slogans who is skilled at manipulating others. His role should be to accompany others, to "put them in the picture," to bring them to the gates of mystery, rather than to "win them over" in the way that politicians or traders draw attention to their latest wares.<br>This must be also apparent in the way we address others. It must be audible and discernible from the very way we speak and the language we use. After all, our language is the fruit of our heart's persuasion. If our language is not empty prattle or mindless production of cliches, it is itself a deed that can do much good. In that sense, "by their fruits shall ye know them" applies to the very way we speak.</p><h2>Catholicism in the Third Millennium</h2><p><p>What is Catholicism?

Can I help you with anything?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> According to my mother, this was Rule One in dealing with this kind of situation: don&#x2019;t project a problem. As in, don&#x2019;t ask if anything is wrong unless you are certain some�thing is, and as of right now, I was not. Although a bride lock�ing herself in the anteroom of the church five minutes <i>after </i>the wedding was supposed to begin did not exactly bode well. <br> &nbsp;<br> From the other side of the door, I heard movement. Then a sniffle. Again, I wished William, my mother&#x2019;s partner and the company&#x2019;s appointed bride whisperer, was here instead of me. But he&#x2019;d gotten hooked into another crisis involving the groom&#x2019;s mother taking issue with preceding the bride&#x2019;s mom down the aisle, even though everyone knew that was how the etiquette went. Work in the wedding business long enough, however, and you learn that everything has the potential to be a problem, from the happy couple all the way down to the napkins. You just never know. <br> &nbsp;<br> I cleared my throat. &#x201c;Deborah? Can I bring you a water?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t ever the true solution, but a water never hurt: that was another one of my mother&#x2019;s beliefs. Instead of a response, the lock clicked, the door rattling open. I looked down the stairs behind me, praying I&#x2019;d see William ap�proaching, but no, I was still alone. I took a breath, then picked up the bottle I&#x2019;d grabbed earlier and stepped inside. Hydration for the win.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our client Deborah Bell (soon to be Washington, ide�ally), a beautiful black girl with her hair in a bun, was sit�ting on the floor of the small room, her fluffy white dress bunched up around her. It had cost five thousand dollars, a fact I knew because she had told us, repeatedly, during the last ten months of planning this day. I tried not to think about this as I moved quickly, but not too quickly, over to her. (&#x201c;Never <i>run </i>at a wedding unless someone&#x2019;s life is liter�ally in danger!&#x201d; I heard my mother say in my head.) I&#x2019;d just opened up the water when I realized she was crying.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t do that.&#x201d; I eased down into what I hoped was a professional knees-to-the-side squat, drawing a slim pack of tissues from my pocket. &#x201c;Your makeup looks great. Let&#x2019;s keep it that way, okay?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Deborah, one false eyelash already loose&#x2014;some lies are necessary&#x2014;just blinked at me, sending another round of tears down her already streaked face. &#x201c;Can I ask you something?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>No</i>, I thought. Now we were at nine minutes. Out loud I said, &#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> She took in a shuddering breath, the kind that only comes after you&#x2019;ve been crying awhile, and hard. &#x201c;Do you . . .&#x201d; A pause, as another set of tears gathered and spilled, this time taking the loose eyelash with them. &#x201c;Do you believe that true love can really last forever?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Now someone was coming up the stairs. From the sound of it, though&#x2014;large steps, lumbering, with a fair amount of huffing and puffing already audible&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t William. &#x201c;True love?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; She reached up&#x2014;God, no! I thought, too late to stop her&#x2014;rubbing a hand over her eyes and smearing eye�liner sideways up to her temple. The steps behind us were getting louder; whoever they belonged to would be here soon. Meanwhile, Deborah was just looking at me, her eyes wide and pleading, as if whatever happened next hinged entirely on my answer. &#x201c;Do you?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I knew she wanted a yes or no, something concise and specific and if this were any other question, I probably could have given it to her. But instead, I just sat there, silent, as I tried to put the image in my head&#x2014;a boy in a white tuxedo shirt on a dark beach, laughing, one hand reached out to me&#x2014;into any kind of words.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Deborah Rachelle Bell!&#x201d; I heard a voice boom from be�hind us. A moment later her father, the Reverend Elijah Bell, appeared, fully filling the space of the open doorway. His suit was tight, the shirt collar loosened, and he had a hand�kerchief in one hand, which he immediately pressed to his sweaty brow. &#x201c;What in the world are you doing? People are waiting down there!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Daddy,&#x201d; Deborah wailed, and then I saw William, finally, climbing the stairs. Just as quickly he dis�appeared from view, though, blocked by the reverend&#x2019;s girth. &#x201c;I just got scared.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, get it together,&#x201d; he told her, stepping inside. Clearly winded, he paused to take a breath or two before continuing. &#x201c;I spent thirty thousand nonrefundable dollars of my hard-earned money on this wedding. If you don&#x2019;t walk down that aisle right now, I&#x2019;ll marry Lucas myself.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> At this, Deborah burst into fresh tears. As I put my hand out to her, helplessly patting a shoulder, William managed to squeeze past the reverend and approach us. Calm as always, he didn&#x2019;t look at me, his eyes on only the bride as he bent close to speak in her ear. She whispered a response as he began to move his hand in slow circles on her back, like you do for a fussy baby.<br> &nbsp;<br> I couldn&#x2019;t hear anything that was said, only the reverend still breathing. Other footsteps were audible on the stairs now, most likely bridesmaids, groomsmen, and others com�ing to rubberneck. Everyone liked to be part of the story, it seemed. I&#x2019;d understood this once, but not so much anymore.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whatever William said had made Deborah smile, albeit shakily. But it was enough; she let him take her elbow and help her to her feet. While she looked down at her wrin�kled dress, trying to shake out the folds, he leaned back into the hallway, beckoning down the stairs. A moment later the makeup artist appeared, her tackle box of prod�ucts in hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay, everyone, let&#x2019;s give Deborah a second to freshen up,&#x201d; William announced to the room, just as, sure enough, one bridesmaid and then another poked their heads in. &#x201c;Rev�erend, can you go tell everyone to take their places? We&#x2019;ll be down in two minutes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better be,&#x201d; the reverend said, pushing past him to the door, sending bridesmaids scattering in a flash of laven�der. &#x201c;Because I am <i>not </i>coming up those stairs again.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be right outside,&#x201d; William told Deborah, gesturing for me to follow him. I did, pulling the door shut behind us.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; I said immediately. &#x201c;That was beyond my skill set.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You did fine,&#x201d; he told me, pulling out his phone. With�out even looking closely, I knew he was firing off a text to my mom in the code they used to ensure both speed and privacy. A second later, I heard a buzz as she wrote back. He scanned the screen, then said, &#x201c;People are curious but there is a minimum of speculation noise, at least so far. It&#x2019;s going to be fine. We&#x2019;ve got the eyelash as an explanation.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I looked at my watch. &#x201c;An eyelash can take fifteen minutes?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It can take an hour, as far as anyone down there knows.&#x201d; He smoothed a wrinkle I couldn&#x2019;t even see out of his pants, then adjusted his red bow tie. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t have pegged Deb as a cold-feeter. Shows what I know.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What did she say to you back there?&#x201d; I asked him.<br> &nbsp;<br> He was listening to the noises beyond the door, alert, I knew, to the aural distinction between crying and get�ting makeup done. After a moment, he said, &#x201c;Oh, she asked about true love. If I believed in it, does it last. Typical stuff pre-ceremony.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What did you say?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Now he looked at me, with that cool, confident counte�nance that made him, along with my mom, the best team in the Lakeview wedding business. &#x201c;I said of course. I couldn&#x2019;t do this job if I didn&#x2019;t. Love is what it&#x2019;s all about.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Wow</i>, I thought. &#x201c;You really believe that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He shuddered. &#x201c;Oh, God, no.&#x201d;<br> Just then the door opened, revealing Deborah, makeup fixed, eyelash in place, dress seemingly perfect. She gave us a nervous smile, and even as I reciprocated I was more aware of William, beaming, than my own expression.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You look beautiful,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do this.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He held out his hand to her and she took it, letting him guide her down the stairs. The makeup lady followed, sigh�ing only loud enough for me to hear, and then I was alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> Down in the church lobby, my mother would be get�ting the wedding party into position, adjusting straps and lapels, fluffing bouquets, and straightening boutonni�res. I looked back into the anteroom, where only a pile of crum�pled tissues now remained. As I hurriedly collected them, I wondered how many other brides had felt the same way in this space, standing on the edge between their present and future, not quite ready to jump. I could sympathize, but only to a point. At least they got to make that choice for themselves. When, instead, it was done for you&#x2014;well, that was something to really cry about. At any rate, now the or�gan music was rising, things beginning. I shut the door and headed downstairs.<br> &nbsp;<br> My mother picked up her wine. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to say seven years. Long enough for a couple of kids and an affair.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Interesting,&#x201d; William replied, holding his own glass aloft and studying it for a moment. Then he said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give it three. No children. But an amicable parting.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You think?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I just get that feeling. Those feet were awfully cold, and asking about true love?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My mom considered this. &#x201c;Point taken. I think you&#x2019;ll win this one. Cheers.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They clinked glasses, then sat back in their chairs, each taking a solemn sip. After every wedding, when the bride and groom were gone and all the guests dispersed to their homes and hotels, my mom and William had one last ritual. They&#x2019;d have a nightcap, recap the event, and lay bets on the marriage it produced. Their accuracy in predicting both outcome and duration was uncanny. And, to be honest, a little unsettling.<br> &nbsp;<br> To me, though, the real test was in the departure. There was just something so telling about that moment when every�one gathered to see the bride and groom off. It wasn&#x2019;t like the ceremony, where people were nervous and could hide things, or the reception, which was usually chaotic enough to blur details. With the leaving, months of planning were behind them, years of a life together ahead. Which was why I&#x2019;d always made a point of watching their faces so carefully, taking note of fatigue, tears, or flickers of irritation. I didn&#x2019;t make a wager as much as a wish for them. I always wanted a happy ending for everyone else. <br> &nbsp;<br> Not that the clients would ever know this. It was the secret finish to what was known in our town of Lakeview as &#x201c;A Natalie Barrett Wedding,&#x201d; an experience so valued by the newly engaged that both a spot on a waitlist and a huge fee were required to even be considered for one. My mom and William&#x2019;s price might be high, but they delivered, the results of their work bound in the four thick, embossed leather al�bums in their office sitting room. Each was packed with im�ages of glowing brides and grooms getting married in every way possible: beachside, while barefoot. Lakeside, in black tie. At a winery. On top of a mountain. In their own (gor�geous, styled for the occasion) backyard. There were huge wedding parties and small intimate ones. Many billowing white dresses with trains, and some in other colors and cuts (signs, I&#x2019;d found, of second or third marriages). The differ�ence between a regular wedding and a Natalie Barrett one was akin to the difference between a pet store and a circus. A wedding was just two people getting married. A Natalie Barrett Wedding was an experience.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Deborah Bell Wedding&#x2014;it was company policy that we referred to all planned events by the bride&#x2019;s name, as it was Her Day&#x2014;was pretty much par for the course for us. The ceremony was at a church, the reception at a nearby hotel ballroom. There were five bridesmaids and five groomsmen, a ring bearer and a flower girl. Their choice of a live band was increasingly rare these days (my moth�er preferred a DJ: the fewer people to wrangle, the better) as was the dinner brought out by waiters (carving stations, buffets, and dessert bars had been more popular for years now). The night had wrapped up with fireworks, an increas�ingly popular request that added a permitting wrinkle but literally a final bang for the client&#x2019;s buck. Despite the earlier dramatics, Deborah had run to the limo clutching her new husband&#x2019;s hand, flushed and happy, smile wide. They&#x2019;d been kissing as the door was shut behind them, to the obvious dis�approval of the reverend, who had then dabbed his own eyes, his wife patting his arm, as the car pulled away. <i>Good luck</i>, I&#x2019;d thought, as the tail lights turned out of sight. <i>May you al�ways have the answers to each other&#x2019;s most important questions.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> And then the wedding was over, for them, anyway. Not for us. First, there was this recap and wager, as well as a final check of the venue for lost items, misplaced wedding gifts, and passed out or, um, otherwise engaged guests (you&#x2019;d be surprised&#x2014;I know I always was). Then we would pack our cars with our clipboards and file folders, mending kits, double-stick tape, boxes of Kleenex, spare power strips, phone chargers, and Xanax (yep), and head home. We usually had exactly one day to recover, after which we were right back at the office in front of my mother&#x2019;s huge whiteboard, where she&#x2019;d circle the next wedding up and it all began again.<br> &nbsp;<br> Despite how my mom and William joked otherwise&#x2014;often&#x2014;they loved this business. For them, it was a passion, and they were good at it. This had been the case long before I&#x2019;d been old enough to work with them during the sum�mers. As a kid, I&#x2019;d colored behind my mother&#x2019;s huge desk while she took meetings with anxious brides about guest lists and seating arrangements. Now I sat alongside them, my own legal pad (in a Natalie Barrett Wedding leather folio, of course) in my lap, taking notes. This transition had always been expected, was basically inevitable. Weddings were the family business, and I was my mother&#x2019;s only family. Unless you counted William, which really, we did.<br> &nbsp;<br> They had met sixteen years earlier, when I was two years old and my dad had just walked out on us. At the time, my parents had been living in a cabin in the woods about ten miles outside Lakeview. There they raised chickens, had an organic garden, and made their own beeswax candles, which they sold at the local farmers&#x2019; market on weekends. My dad, only twenty-two, had a full beard, rarely wore shoes, and was working on a chapbook of environmentally themed po�ems that had been in progress since before I&#x2019;d even been conceived. My mom, a year younger, was full vegan, waited tables in the evenings at a nearby organic co-op caf�, and made rope bracelets blessed with &#x201c;earth energy&#x201d; on the side. They had met in college, at a campus protest against the public education system, which was, apparently, &#x201c;oppressive, misogynist, cruel to animals, and evil.&#x201d; This was verbatim from the flyer I&#x2019;d found in a box deep in my mother&#x2019;s closet that held the only things she&#x2019;...</p><h2>Murder by an Aristocrat (An American Mystery Classic)</h2><p><p><strong>After a murder at the manor where she&#x2019;s employed, a nurse trades her stethoscope for a magnifying glass...</strong></p><p>When Nurse Keate arrives at the Thatcher estate to care for a man with a bullet in his shoulder, she&#x2019;s told that he shot himself accidentally&#x2015;but when the convalescing man is murdered soon thereafter, it becomes clear that the only &#x201c;accident&#x201d; was his not being fully killed the first time around.

Known for his profound mystical wisdom combined with a sublime sensuousness, Hafiz was the supreme master of a poetic form known as the <i>ghazal</i> (pronounced "guzzle"), an ode or song consisting of rhymed couplets celebrating divine love. In this selection of his poems, wine and the intoxication it brings are the image that expresses this love in all its joyful abandon, painful longing, bewilderment, and surrender. Through ninety-five free-verse renditions, we gain entry into the mystical world of Hafiz's Winehouse, with its happy minstrels, its bewitching Winebringer, and its companions in drunken longing whose hearts cry out, "More wine!" Thomas Rain Crowe brings a new dimension to our growing appreciation of Hafiz and his wise drunkard's advice to the seekers of God:<br>In this world of illusion, take nothing other than this cup of wine; <br>In this playhouse, don't play any games but love.</p><p>Thomas Rain Crowe is a poet, translator, editor, publisher, recording artist, and the author of ten books. Hailed as one of the "Baby Beats" of the 1970s, he has been described as "what happens when Kabir, Rumi, and Sydney Lanier meet the Dharma Bums." Crowe is a frequent performer at poetry festivals and Sufi events, reciting Hafiz poems to the musical accompaniment of his band, the Boatrockers. Among his recent books are&nbsp;<i>In Wineseller's Street:&nbsp;Renderings of Hafiz&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;Water from the Moon.&nbsp;</i>Thomas Crowe lives in Culowhee, North Carolina."Thomas Rain Crowe brings the Persian <b> <i> </i> </b>Sufi poet Hafiz (1326&#x2013;1390) to life in this lively version of his timeless work. A fine addition to the growing number of English translations of his work."&#x2014;<i>The Bloomsbury Review </i><br>"Takes us home to the truths that transcend political factionalism, religious fanaticism, and literary provincialism. . . . Thomas Rain Crowe takes this ancient form and makes it alive with our own language while still retaining the echoes of the old ways embodied in the ghazal."&#x2014;<i>Parabola</i> <br><br>"Hafiz speaks the immortal language of love today through Thomas Rain Crowe."&#x2014;Shaykh Sherif Baba, head of the Turkish Rifa'i-Marufi Sufi Order of America<br>"The source, the gravity, and the light that will direct us home is Love. Hafiz is a poet intoxicated by this incredible Love&#x2014;a wise-drunk man&#x2014;how rare! Thomas Rain Crowe brings this illuminating poetry to this edge of centuries as we continue to look for love&#x2014;perfect timing for these songs."&#x2014;Joy Harjo, author of <i>In Mad Love and War </i><br>"This book is an inspiring reflection of the best of what humanity has to give.

The phone rang, but she allowed the answering machine to pick up. She crossed the hall to her bedroom, where she stripped out of her jeans and George Washington University hoodie. Inside her walk-�in closet, she stared at the racks of clothing and debated which of her cemetery dresses to wear. She had four from which to choose. Cat spent way too much time in cemeteries.<br><br>A year and a half ago she&#x2019;d joined Arlington Ladies, an organization of volunteers who attended military services at Arlington National Cemetery in order to make sure that no soldier was buried alone. When she paid her respects to the fallen, Cat represented the thanks of a nation for the soldier&#x2019;s service and sacrifice, and she was proud to do so. No one should be laid to rest without someone there to note the passing of a life. Not a soldier, not an old man or woman.<br><br>Not a baby.<br><br>Grief washed over Cat and she shut her eyes, accepting it. Today was a day for remembering, the one day of the year when she allowed herself to wallow in her heartache. Today she wasn&#x2019;t going to Arlington, but to Rose Hill Cemetery in Hagerstown, Maryland.<br><br>She scanned her closet&#x2019;s contents again, but nothing felt right until she spied the red cashmere sweater. Forget the black dresses. Today, she&#x2019;d wear red&#x2014;�the color of love.<br><br>She donned the sweater and a pair of gray wool slacks. She had just slipped into her shoes when she heard her doorbell ring. Immediately she tensed. Surely this wasn&#x2019;t her dad, not after the lecture she&#x2019;d given him last year. You&#x2019;d think that after five years, George Blackburn would get the fact that she needed to do this by herself.<br><br>Her bedroom window overlooked the front yard, so she glanced outside. The only car in her driveway was her white Mercedes convertible, a recent gift to herself for having won the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting for her series on fraudulent charities. Nor did she see her father&#x2019;s eight-�year-�old Volvo station wagon at the curb. When the doorbell rang again, followed by three raps against the wood, a pause, then two additional raps, she relaxed. That was her next-�door neighbor&#x2019;s usual knock.<br><br>Marsha Wells, the bubbly stay-�at-�home mother of a second-�grader and a toddler, stood on the stoop. She began speaking the moment Cat answered the door. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t believe this. It&#x2019;s the most horrible thing.&#x201d;<br><br>Concerned, Cat waved her inside. &#x201c;What happened? Are your kids okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re fine. This isn&#x2019;t about us. I spoke to Janie from Paw Pals a few minutes ago. Boy, was she furious.&#x201d;<br><br>Janie Pemberton was the director of Paw Pals, the canine rescue organization that was another of Cat&#x2019;s volunteer causes. &#x201c;Something to do with Paw Pals?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Indirectly. She says she&#x2019;s stumbled upon a dogfighting ring operating here in town. Some prominent people might be involved.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;With dogfighting?&#x201d; Cat shook her head. Prominent people in this part of the world meant politicians. Politicians and prostitution she&#x2019;d believe. Drugs wouldn&#x2019;t surprise her. But dogfighting? Other than child porn or murder, she couldn&#x2019;t think of anything that would derail a politician&#x2019;s career faster than being involved in dogfighting. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t believe it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s convinced. And Janie is no fool. You know that.&#x201d;<br><br>Cat nodded. Janie was a dynamo of energy with a quick, intelligent mind.<br><br>Marsha continued. &#x201c;I think you should call and talk to her about it, Cat. This could be right up your alley.&#x201d;<br><br>The old, familiar buzz that she experienced whenever a new story came her way shot through Cat, but she immediately dismissed it. Such things could wait. This was not the time. &#x201c;Thanks for the tip. I&#x2019;ll call her this evening.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excellent.&#x201d; Her eyes gleaming with satisfaction, Marsha shifted the topic of conversation by giving Cat&#x2019;s outfit a once-�over. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re all dressed up. Looking gorgeous as always, I might add. How is it that you can wear red so well when you&#x2019;re a redhead? If I didn&#x2019;t like you so much I&#x2019;d hate you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you. I think.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought you had an Arlington Ladies commitment today.&#x201d;<br><br>Cat frowned. She wouldn&#x2019;t have booked anything for today. &#x201c;Why did you think that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;When I handed you my grocery shopping list last night, I&#x2019;d have sworn I saw &#x2018;cemetery flowers&#x2019; written on yours.&#x201d;<br><br>Oh. Cat didn&#x2019;t know how to respond to that. She didn&#x2019;t like to lie, but Marsha didn&#x2019;t know anything about her past. Hardly anyone did. Luckily, she didn&#x2019;t need to respond because Marsha continued to talk.<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks again for coming to my rescue. We were down to our last diaper, and I would never have heard the end of it if Aiden didn&#x2019;t have a banana for his breakfast this morning, but the thought of loading him into the car seat one more time . . .&#x201d; Marsha shuddered dramatically.<br><br>&#x201c;I was glad to help.&#x201d; And she was thrilled to avoid talk about cemetery flowers. &#x201c;Speaking of rescue, how are things going at your house with your new foster? Is he settling in okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So far so good. He has an appointment at the vet tomorrow for heartworm treatment. How about you? Are you ready for your next baby?&#x201d;<br><br>Inwardly, Cat winced. Today of all days, she didn&#x2019;t want to think of the dogs she fostered as babies. &#x201c;Actually, I&#x2019;m taking a break from fostering for a little while. I told Janie I&#x2019;d help with the website and shelter visits and even do some sitting when our volunteers need help, but I&#x2019;m trying to schedule some major remodeling so it&#x2019;s probably best I don&#x2019;t have dogs here full time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know that Janie is thrilled to have you do anything you want to help out,&#x201d; Marsha said. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t take this the wrong way, Cat, but I&#x2019;m so glad the newspaper laid you off.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not complaining. I like the freelance life more than I ever imagined. And the dogs who come to your house are lucky, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know about that.&#x201d; Exasperation wrinkled Marsha&#x2019;s brow. &#x201c;Aiden keeps stealing their food. Fosters at your house don&#x2019;t have to compete for their supper with an eleven-�month-�old kibble thief.&#x201d;<br><br>Cat worked to keep her smile on her face as she finished up the conversation. Once she&#x2019;d shut the door safely behind Marsha, her smile faded. Tears stung her eyes and she blinked them away. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; she lectured herself aloud. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s natural that the mention of Aiden breaks your heart today. Perfectly normal. Don&#x2019;t sweat it.&#x201d;<br><br>She pulled her coat from the closet, locked the front door, then went to the refrigerator where she removed a bouquet of yellow roses wrapped in green tissue. Five minutes later, she was on her way.<br><br>A cold, blustery wind buffeted the car and patches of snow clung to the shady spots beside the road. Cat cranked up the heater in her car. She listened to a classic rock station on the radio during the first half of her trip, but as she drew nearer to her destination, she switched off the noise and allowed silence to settle over her.<br><br>Had someone asked Cat what she thought about as she drove, she couldn&#x2019;t have said. She spent the trip clearing her mind and preparing her heart, and by the time she turned in to the entrance to the cemetery, she was as ready as she ever would be. Though she hadn&#x2019;t been to Rose Hill since this same day last year, she knew exactly where to go&#x2014;�the Angel Land section. She walked the rows of flat markers, knelt beside the grave she&#x2019;d come to visit, then opened her mind to dreams she ordinarily kept locked away.<br><br>She imagined a toddler with dark curls playing with a fluffy white puppy. She pictured a preschooler with finger paint on her hands standing in front of a child-�size easel. Next, it was a second-�grader sitting in her lap and learning to read, then a fourth-�grader coming up to bat at softball practice.<br><br>Today would have been Lauren Ann Davenport&#x2019;s fifth birthday.<br><br>Cat remained beside the grave for almost an hour. She reflected on her memories, said a few prayers, and allowed the tears to fall as she mourned those things that she had cherished and lost. When the moment felt right, she laid the bouquet of yellow roses below the marker, pressed a kiss to her fingertips, then touched the raised letters of the name recorded there. &#x201c;Happy birthday, baby. I love you.&#x201d;<br><br>Cat Blackburn turned and walked away from the grave of her only child.<br><br>She never noticed the figure of the man who stood behind the shelter of a nearby evergreen, silently watching.<br><br>Five months later<br><br>&#x201c;She calls that security?&#x201d; Jack Davenport muttered with disgust, watching as the idiot wearing a shoulder holster flashed Cat Blackburn a smarmy grin.<br><br>Moments before, Cat&#x2019;s little Mercedes sports car had pulled in to the driveway of her home in a quiet suburban neighborhood. From inside her house, Jack noticed that the pretty-�boy bodyguard hadn&#x2019;t paid any attention to the pool service truck parked next door in the Wellses&#x2019; driveway. While it was true that the truck sported the same logo as the service used by the vacationing Wells family, any security guard worth his permit would check out the vehicle before allowing his charge to exit her car.<br><br>What surprised him was that Cat remained so oblivious. After all, she&#x2019;s the one whose house had been firebombed earlier this week. She should be more careful! It was almost as if she were daring the culprit to have another go at her.<br><br>It made Jack want to wring her neck. Right after he made the bodyguard pay for his inattention.<br><br>Jack had followed Cat and her escort from her home, to the dry cleaners, then a pet store, and finally to an animal shelter where she picked up a dog. The security loser never looked at Jack&#x2019;s ride twice. He was too busy checking out Cat&#x2019;s chest and ogling her ass.<br><br>Jack wanted to shoot him on principle. He&#x2019;d seriously considered breaking bones&#x2014;�a leg would be good&#x2014;�in order to demonstrate to the incompetent jackass that a career move was in order. Doing so would be a public service. Instead, once the bug he&#x2019;d planted in her car picked up the order she&#x2019;d made for takeout at her favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant, an indication that she was finally headed home, he&#x2019;d postponed his contemplated punishment and made his way to her house ahead of her.<br><br>Now, the sound of Cat&#x2019;s laughter drifted through the window he&#x2019;d cracked open, and he set his teeth. She wore a flirty yellow sundress, strappy heeled sandals, and oversized sunglasses. She pulled a designer dog tote filled with a puffball of four-�legged fur from the backseat of the Mercedes. Her wavy auburn hair was pulled up in a ponytail, and as she approached the house, she looked more like a coed than a woman in her mid-�thirties who paid no more attention to her surroundings than did her sorry excuse for security.<br><br>No wonder Melinda had assigned this job to him. Cat Blackburn couldn&#x2019;t bat her pretty eyes and turn him into a worthless blob of testosterone. No, he was immune to the woman&#x2019;s admittedly significant appeal. He&#x2019;d been vaccinated.<br><br>Beautiful, stubborn fool, he thought as he watched her pause halfway to the kitchen door, hand the dog to the bodyguard, and dig in her purse for her phone. Blithely, she stood right there out in the open and double-�thumbed out a text message. He had thought the woman had more sense than to leave herself exposed that way, but maybe not. After all, she&#x2019;d managed to stir up a hornet&#x2019;s nest with her blog expos� about the dogfighters.<br><br>The piece had gone live on the Internet three weeks ago. The day before yesterday, someone had firebombed her house. True, it hadn&#x2019;t been a big explosion, but fire was fire. Fire was serious business, and Jack knew that better than most. Luckily, she&#x2019;d been sitting on the living room sofa when the Molotov cocktail sailed through the picture window and exploded in her dining room.<br><br>Imagining the moment, his stomach took a sick turn.<br><br>And what had been Cat&#x2019;s response? To hire protection who was more bodybuilder than bodyguard. What the hell was she thinking?<br><br>As much as he wanted to teach Mr. Ass-�gazer a lesson, Jack knew he had to restrain the urge. This operation needed to be slick and quick. Better he stick to his original plan.<br><br>Though when the security guy reached up and playfully tugged Cat&#x2019;s ponytail, Jack reconsidered. Maybe one well-�placed kick wouldn&#x2019;t hurt anything.<br><br>She dropped her phone back into her purse and resumed her stroll toward her kitchen door. Silent as a ghost, Jack moved past the brand-�new dining room window and into the kitchen, taking up position. Waiting for her to slip her key into the lock, Jack realized with a touch of chagrin that his pulse pounded in a way that it rarely had on missions. Honesty made him admit that he worried more about dealing with Cat than he ever did about dying on the job.<br><br>Bodyguard Ken entered the kitchen ahead of her. &#x201c;Idiot,&#x201d; Jack muttered as he took the man down and knocked him out with a pair of smooth, practiced, lightning-�quick kicks.<br><br>He&#x2019;d be lying if he denied the pleasure it gave him, or the satisfaction he felt when he plunged the hypodermic needle into Cat Blackburn&#x2019;s shoulder and she collapsed, unconscious, into his arms.<br><br>He used duct tape to secure the idiot guard, then lifted Cat over his shoulder and carried her to the garage, where he transferred her into the scroungy old SUV she used for hauling dogs as part of her work for the rescue group. As a precaution, he used the tape to bind her ankles and wrists and muffle her mouth. He&#x2019;d gone heavy on the drug. The last thing he needed was to have her come to on the highway and cause a wreck.<br><br>He climbed into the driver&#x2019;s seat, then hesitated. What about the dog? He hadn&#x2019;t planned for that particular complication, but he liked dogs. For all he knew, Bodyguard Bozo would wake up angry and take it out on the purse pet.<br><br>He went back and got the dog.<br><br>They exited the garage and the neighborhood without incident. Once they&#x2019;d gained the beltway, he phoned Melinda. She answered on the first ring. &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have her. We&#x2019;ll be wheels up within the hour.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excellent. The guard?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is a tool. I put him on the sofa in the den.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take care of him.&#x201d; After a brief hesitation, she asked, &#x201c;How is she, Jack?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not a scratch on her. She&#x2019;ll have a slight headache when she wakes up, but we knew to expect that.&#x201d;<br><br>The relieved sigh was almost inaudible. &#x201c;Yes. All right, then. Safe travels. You&#x2019;ll be in touch?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely.&#x201d; He hung up and made the rest of the trip to the airfield in silence. Though he concentrated on driving, he remained intensely aware of the woman slumped in the seat beside him and stole glances whenever traffic allowed.<br><br>She no longer looked like Coed Barbie. This was the soft, slumbering Kitten he&#x2019;d known and loved once upon a time.<br><br>Afternoon sunshine beamed through slatted wood blinds and woke Jack to the sound of the surf, the musty scent of sex, and soft snuffle of the naked woman lying next to him. He filled his lungs with air and a lazy grin stretched across his face. He couldn&#x2019;t ever recall feeling so . . . pleasured.<br><br>Rolling up on his elbow, he watched her sleep. Cat was an apt name for her, he decided. Two hours ago, he&#x2019;d watched her stride along the beach, sleek and strong, confident and utterly feminine in her next-�to-�nothing bikini. He&#x2019;d been in their room on a phone call&#x2014;� an important work call&#x2014;�and he&#x2019;d completely lost his train of thought.

A formidable musicologist with a lively polemical style, he discusses the composer's works with greater understanding and clarity than any previous biographer. And whereas many have recycled the same erroneous, often damaging information, Walker has relied on his own prodigious, globe-trotting research, a project spanning twenty-five years. The result is a textured portrait of Liszt and his times without rival."&#x2015;Elliot Ravetz, <em>Time</em></p><p>"The prose is so lively that the reader is often swept along by the narrative. . . .

Washington, Julius Rosenwald, and the Building of Schools for the Segregated South</h2><p>Booker T. Washington, the founder of Tuskegee Institute, and Julius Rosenwald, the president of Sears, Roebuck, and Company, first met in 1911 at a Chicago luncheon. By charting the lives of these two men both before and after the meeting, Stephanie Deutsch offers a fascinating glimpse into the partnership that would bring thousands of modern schoolhouses to African American communities in the rural South in the era leading up to the civil rights movement. Trim and vital at just shy of fifty, Rosenwald was the extraordinarily rich chairman of one of the nation&#x2019;s largest businesses, interested in using his fortune to do good not just in his own Jewish community but also to promote the well-being of African Americans.&nbsp;<br><br>Washington, though widely admired, had weathered severe crises both public and private in his fifty-six years. He had dined with President Theodore Roosevelt and drunk tea with Queen Victoria, but he had also been assaulted on a street in New York City. He had suffered personal heartbreak, years of overwork, and the discouraging knowledge that, despite his optimism and considerable success, conditions for African Americans were not improving as he had assumed they would. From within his own community, Washington faced the bitter charge of accommodationism that haunts his legacy to this day. Despite their differences, the two men would work together well and their collaboration would lead to the building of five thousand schoolhouses. By the time segregation ended, the &#x201c;Rosenwald Schools&#x201d; that sprang from this unlikely partnership were educating one third of the South&#x2019;s African American children. These schoolhouses represent a significant step in the ongoing endeavor to bring high quality education to every child in the United States&#x2014;an ideal that remains to be realized even today.</p><p><p>Stephanie Deutsch is a writer and critic living in Washington, DC.

It spanned six hundred leagues and more, fading out of sight above, where it met with the azure ceiling. Its length was unmarked; its width unmeasured; its touch cool; its look foreboding and ageless.<br>The Regent had built it in the days of the Second Wave, and expanded it in the days of the Third. He had built his home into it, and out from it.<br>The foundations of the Southern Hold were deep into the bedrock of Heaven, carved and scorched with the fires of Belial, made immutable by the sceptre of Yaweh. Plain and grey like the Wall, the Hold rose over grassland and stoney plain, even and unbroken until its northern wall ended abruptly and became a roof that sloped sharply up to the top. There it blended into the Wall, giving the impression that the entire affair was an accidental blister from the Wall and would soon sink back into it.<br>The only entrance was built into the northern wall of the Hold. Here were placed a pair of massive oak doors, with finely carved wooden handles.<br>A visitor to the Hold, no matter how often he had been there, would be moved by the stature of the hard grey edifice&#x2014;lonely, cold, distant, and proud. Like the Regent of the South himself, some said. But once inside, the illusion was shattered.<br>The visitor, a medium-sized golden haired dog, padded through the hallway. Being a dog, and therefore colorblind, he didn&#x2019;t see the cheerful blue of the walls. But he noticed the brightness of the lamps of iron and glass, one every twenty dogpaces. The oil for the lamps, pressed from local vegetation and refined in the basement of the Hold, had been scented with lilac.<br>The dog continued until he came to an archway. There was a small chamber, with large green couches and overstuffed chairs. The north wall held a burgundy-colored buffet, with cups and bottles of cut glass and stoneware. The lamps were always low in this room, but the dog heard the sounds of breathing, and smelled a friend.<br>He leapt onto a couch, facing this friend across a table of glass. Neither spoke; the dog moved slightly toward the Regent, who was seated with one leg on the table, his left arm across the back of the couch, his right hand loosely holding a glass into which he was staring. The dog caught a strong, sweet smell from the glass.<br>&#x201c;&#x2019;Tis but cheap wine, milord,&#x201c; he said.<br>&#x201c;It fits my mood, friend Beelzebub. I&#x2019;m feeling cheap today.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hath thy mood a cause, Lord?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;All things have a cause, my friend.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Would&#x2019;st care to speak on&#x2019;t?&#x201d;<br>His answer was silence. Beelzebub studied his friend as best he could in the dim light. The Regent was smooth shaven and somewhat dark of complexion. His hair was dark brown, almost black, perhaps a bit wavy, and curled over the ears. His brows were thick, his eyes narrow, yet wide-set, with shocking green irises and lines of humor or anger around the edges. His jaw was strong, his nose straight and pronounced; and he wore colors matching his eyes beneath a cloak that was full and gold. Brown boots covered his feet, and upon his chest was an emerald, as large as his fist, on a chain of gold.<br>Beelzebub studied him for a moment longer. &#x201c;Perchance &#x2019;twould do thee good to speak, Lord Satan.&#x201d;<br>The Regent set down his wine glass, found a small bowl, and poured into it.<br>&#x201c;Maybe. Drink.&#x201d;<br>The dog moved forward on the couch, sniffed, but kept his opinion to himself. He lapped up a bit and managed not to shudder.<br>&#x201c;What do you, friend Beelzebub, think of Yaweh&#x2019;s plans regarding the Fourth Wave?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Milord? Then it draweth nigh?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Who can say? It&#x2019;ll come eventually.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Soon?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not that we know. But Yaweh wants to be ready this time. He wants to build a place that will be safe from the flux.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Verily, have we not that now?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not permanently. What he has in mind is a place that&#x2019;s complete by itself, and won&#x2019;t be subject to Waves at all.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hmmm. Ambitious, nay?&#x201d;<br>Satan glanced at him sharply. &#x201c;You sound skeptical.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thy pardon, milord&#x2014;who is&#x2019;t shall build this place? They must deal with the outside, so they must needs risk the ultimate end. Who is&#x2019;t shall do this? Thyself and thy brethren? You are strong, but only seven. Those of us from the Second Wave? We&#x2019;re less than a score of scores; the task is beyond us. Those of the Third Wave? Aye, they can do&#x2019;t, milord. Will they? For they know naught of such things save the fear of them. They must needs see the danger ere they fight it, I fear.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You have a way,&#x201c; said Satan, &#x201c;of getting right to the heart of things.&#x201d;<br>* * *<br><em>&#x201c;It cannot last, &#x201c; says the first</em>.<br><em>&#x201c;We will make it last,&#x201c; says the second</em>.<br><em>&#x201c;We will build walls that are yet stronger,&#x201c; says the third</em>.<br><em>They must be larger,&#x201c; says the fourth, &#x201c;for there will be more of us.&#x201d;</em><br><em>That is good,&#x201c; says the second</em>.<br><em>&#x201c;Aye,&#x201c; says the first. &#x201c;Let us begin, then, for I see the walls crumble before me</em>.&#x201d;<br><em>And the evening and the morning are the Second Wave</em>.<br>* * *<br>&#x201c;Milord?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hmmm&#x2014;yes?&#x201d;<br>Thou seem&#x2019;d befuddled.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I was thinking.

His topics include alder and cedar; jellyfish, geoducks, crabs, and killer whales; mosquitoes and spiders; gulls, crows, and bald eagles; and sea otters, coyotes, raccoons, possums, deer, and cougars.<br><br>This informative and engaging selection of natural history essays is adapted from articles published in the Seattle Times magazine, <i>Pacific Northwest.</i> A native Washingtonian, Dietrich has watched the Northwest double in population during his lifetime. Our rapidly changing view of nature is an underlying theme throughout his wide-ranging essays, as is the timely and essential question of how best to share and conserve the natural world that drew us to the region in the first place.<br><br>Not a field guide nor an environmental policy book, <i>Natural Grace</i> is intended as a primer for people who are curious about the environment they live in and the pressures upon it. "We only care about what we know," says the author. "I&#x2019;ve concluded that enthusiasm and commitment begin from learning just how marvelous this region is: Passion has to precede purpose." And there is much to marvel over. Dietrich has unearthed fascinating and unexpected facts about his subjects, and he has a gift for expressing complex information in clear and vivid language. He asks intriguing questions and makes good use of interviews with Northwest scientists and experts to convey current and historic attitudes and economic realities, and to consider where we go from here.</p><p><p>A collection of essays by a Pulitzer Prize winning author exploring the natural splendors of the Pacific Northwest</p><b>William Dietrich </b>is a staff writer for the <i>Seattle Times' Pacific Northwest</i> magazine.

Here she discusses a very practical skill and provides some fine patterns for a very simple shape&#x2014;squares. Knitters most often use squares, or blocks, as Epstein calls them, for gauge swatches. But, actually, they are the most versatile of constructions and can be used for sweaters, toys, and, of course, afghans. Although she begins by showing simple squares done in seed and garter stitches, Epstein quickly moves on to embossed, cabled, colored, and appliqu�d squares, all of which will get knitters&#x2019; hands twitchy. Then come instructions, in words and charts, for the patterns, some involved, like an afghan, and others, like a hat and scarf, fairly quick to make. A bag looks particularly enticing. Back matter includes information about edgings, a detailed glossary, and a list of charities on which to bestow finished projects. More than 180 color illustrations add to the pleasure of this appealing book. --Ilene Cooper</p><h2>Demon-Haunted World, The</h2><p><p>How can we make intelligent decisions about our increasingly technology-driven lives if we don't understand the difference between the myths of pseudoscience and the testable hypotheses of science? Pulitzer Prize-winning author and distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan argues that scientific thinking is critical not only to the pursuit of truth but to the very well-being of our democratic institutions.</p><p></p><p>Casting a wide net through history and culture, Sagan examines and authoritatively debunks such celebrated fallacies of the past as witchcraft, faith healing, demons, and UFOs. And yet, disturbingly, in today's so-called information age, pseudoscience is burgeoning with stories of alien abduction, channeling past lives, and communal hallucinations commanding growing attention and respect. As Sagan demonstrates with lucid eloquence, the siren song of unreason is not just a cultural wrong turn but a dangerous plunge into darkness that threatens our most basic freedoms.</p><p></p><p>Introductory music from the original score for <i>COSMOS: A SpaceTime Odyssey</i> composed by Alan Silvestri, used with permission from Cosmos Studios, Inc. and Chappers Music.

Along the way he debunks alien abduction, faith-healing, and channeling; refutes the arguments that science destroys spirituality, and provides a &#34;baloney detection kit&#34; for thinking through political, social, religious, and other issues.Are we on the brink of a new Dark Age of irrationality and superstition? In this stirring, brilliantly argued book, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Dragons of Eden and Cosmos shows how scientific thinking can cut through prejudice and hysteria and uncover the truth, and how it is necessary to safeguard our democratic institutions and our technical civilization.</p>
